To date, the Anticapture Commission has played an important role in <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/request-for-information-recent-upgrades-to-governor-contract/7535\">pushing</a> for the continued decentralization of governance infrastructure and processes. The Foundation has consulted the Anticapture Commission on several related matters, as has Agora. These conversations have resulted in all changes to the governance contract now going through the Protocol Upgrade governance process. We believe the Anticapture Commission will continue to play an important role in the Collective as we <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/onboarding-op-chains-to-optimism-governance/7858\">welcome</a> ~10 additional OP Chains to the ecosystem through the end of Season 6.</p>\n<p>The Anticapture Commission is an experimental and first of its kind governance structure. Through this experiment, the Commission itself is refining its role and discovering the highest impact ways to contribute to the resilience of our governance system.  The below amendments to the Commission Charter are proposed based directly on member feedback.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"charter-amendment-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#charter-amendment-2\"></a>Charter Amendment</h2>\n<p>The Anticapture Commission has the below mandate (refined.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Anticapture Commission exists to prevent capture of the Token House by any one stakeholder or group of stakeholders (protocols, OP Chains, etc.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please note this commission\u2019s duties are in service to tokenholders. The commission may not explicitly limit tokenholder power and may not limit the rights of tokenholders in favor of any other stakeholder group in any way.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"goals-refined-for-clarity-and-to-reduce-scope-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#goals-refined-for-clarity-and-to-reduce-scope-3\"></a>Goals (refined for clarity and to reduce scope):</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide alerts to the Citizens\u2019 House when concerns arise over significant imbalances in power between groups of stakeholders using the process outlined here. Please note any member of the community may flag a concern to be considered by the anticapture commission via the commission\u2019s email.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vote on all proposals that are subject to a Citizens\u2019 House veto. The Commission is not expected to cast votes on all proposals but exercising the Commission\u2019s delegation is important to passing Protocol Upgrades, and any other proposals subject to Citizens\u2019 House veto.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While not required, the Commission may also chose to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Advocate for the continued decentralization of governance infrastructure and processes, so no one party exercises undue influence over the system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Research, analyze, and advocate for transparency related to the distribution of voting power.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"membership-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#membership-4\"></a>Membership</h2>\n<p>Membership will continue to be comprised of high impact delegates but Council Leads will no longer qualify, separate of meeting membership criteria.

We will eliminate the mid-point recalculation as it adds substantial overhead, creates disruptive onboarding requirements, and did not result in substantial turnover.</p>\n<p>Anticapture Commission votes are cast based on a simply majority of individual member votes, unless the Commission Internal Operating Procedures stipulate otherwise.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"member-responsibilities-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#member-responsibilities-5\"></a>Member Responsibilities</h3>\n<p>In exchange for being entrusted with additional voting power, Anticapture Commission members will be expected to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Members will be expected to vote on 70% of all ACC votes expected to be cast in the Token House. Last season, participation requirements were underspecified. If a Member does not meet this expectation, they will not be eligible to be on the Anticapture Commission the following Season. This is in line with the voting participation requirements of top delegates and all delegation programs in the Collective.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The requirements to attend/host office hours and provide delegate approvals will be removed, based on member feedback.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is recommended, but not required, that members attend internal meetings and/or community office hours, as appropriate.

We believe the Anticapture Commission will continue to play an important role in the Collective as we <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/onboarding-op-chains-to-optimism-governance/7858\">welcome</a> ~10 additional OP Chains to the ecosystem through the end of Season 6.</p>\n<p>The Anticapture Commission is an experimental and first of its kind governance structure. Through this experiment, the Commission itself is refining its role and discovering the highest impact ways to contribute to the resilience of our governance system.  The below amendments to the Commission Charter are proposed based directly on member feedback.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"charter-amendment-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#charter-amendment-2\"></a>Charter Amendment</h2>\n<p>The Anticapture Commission has the below mandate (refined.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Anticapture Commission exists to prevent capture of the Token House by any one stakeholder or group of stakeholders (protocols, OP Chains, etc.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please note this commission\u2019s duties are in service to tokenholders. The commission may not explicitly limit tokenholder power and may not limit the rights of tokenholders in favor of any other stakeholder group in any way.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"goals-refined-for-clarity-and-to-reduce-scope-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#goals-refined-for-clarity-and-to-reduce-scope-3\"></a>Goals (refined for clarity and to reduce scope):</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide alerts to the Citizens\u2019 House when concerns arise over significant imbalances in power between groups of stakeholders using the process outlined here. Please note any member of the community may flag a concern to be considered by the anticapture commission via the commission\u2019s email.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vote on all proposals that are subject to a Citizens\u2019 House veto. The Commission is not expected to cast votes on all proposals but exercising the Commission\u2019s delegation is important to passing Protocol Upgrades, and any other proposals subject to Citizens\u2019 House veto.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While not required, the Commission may also chose to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Advocate for the continued decentralization of governance infrastructure and processes, so no one party exercises undue influence over the system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Research, analyze, and advocate for transparency related to the distribution of voting power.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"membership-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#membership-4\"></a>Membership</h2>\n<p>Membership will continue to be comprised of high impact delegates but Council Leads will no longer qualify, separate of meeting membership criteria. Several Council Leads resigned last Season as they didn\u2019t have the ability or context required to contribute meaningfully.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Members must be an individual or professional delegate and not a representative of a protocol or corporation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Members, as described above, must be in the top 100 delegates <strong>AND</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintain = &gt; 70% voting participation over the previous Season (including the following Reflection Period.) This requirement has been simplified to ensure delegates have enough context without overcomplicating criteria.</li>\n<li>Have received retro voter rewards in any of S1-S5</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All qualifying members must opt-in to be part of the Commission. <strong>Please note: All members need to KYC to vote as a member of the Anticapture Commission.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Membership will be determined based on the above criteria at the beginning of each Season. We will eliminate the mid-point recalculation as it adds substantial overhead, creates disruptive onboarding requirements, and did not result in substantial turnover.</p>\n<p>Anticapture Commission votes are cast based on a simply majority of individual member votes, unless the Commission Internal Operating Procedures stipulate otherwise.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"member-responsibilities-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#member-responsibilities-5\"></a>Member Responsibilities</h3>\n<p>In exchange for being entrusted with additional voting power, Anticapture Commission members will be expected to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Members will be expected to vote on 70% of all ACC votes expected to be cast in the Token House. Last season, participation requirements were underspecified. If a Member does not meet this expectation, they will not be eligible to be on the Anticapture Commission the following Season. This is in line with the voting participation requirements of top delegates and all delegation programs in the Collective.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The requirements to attend/host office hours and provide delegate approvals will be removed, based on member feedback.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is recommended, but not required, that members attend internal meetings and/or community office hours, as appropriate. Members that cannot attend should provide async feedback on drafts or meeting notes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All other requirements for members and the Lead will remain the same, with the exception of the elimination of the Lead\u2019s former responsibilities around calculating mid-point membership. See <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-anticapture-commission-amended/8132\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The frequency of internal meetings is at the discretion of the Commission Lead but should be aligned with governance minimization.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is recommended, but not required, for members to make best efforts to provide feedback on and/or contribute to authorship of any reports circulated to the Citizens\u2019 House.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The new charter, updated with the above changes, can be viewed in its entirety <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-anticapture-commission-amended/8132\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"qualifying-delegates-to-be-updated-below-at-conclusion-of-special-voting-cycle-23a-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#qualifying-delegates-to-be-updated-below-at-conclusion-of-special-voting-cycle-23a-6\"></a>Qualifying Delegates (to be updated below at conclusion of Special Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#23a</span>)</h3>\n<p>If you would like to be a part of the ACC for Season 6 \u2013 <a href=\"https://forms.gle/Pn3QZdDymfidGadK6\">this</a> form <strong>must</strong> be filled out before <strong>June 14 23:00 UTC</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/kaereste\">@kaereste</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/linda\">@linda</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/polynya\">@polynya</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/lefterisjp\">@lefterisjp</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/olimpio\">@olimpio</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/gfxlabs\">@GFXlabs</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/jackanorak\">@jackanorak</a></li>\n<li>OPSNX Ambassadors</li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/michael\">@Michael</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/she256\">@she256</a></li>\n<li>Synthetix</li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/brichis\">@brichis</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/joxes\">@Joxes</a></li>\n<li>Pool Collective</li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/katie\">@katie</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/pgov\">@PGov</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/404dao\">@404DAO</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/blockchainatusc\">@blockchainatusc</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/gauntlet\">@Gauntlet</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/tane\">@Tane</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/griff\">@Griff</a></li>\n<li>0xb933aee47c438f22de0747d57fc239fe37878dd1</li>\n<li>0x9d31e30003f253563ff108bc60b16fdf2c93abb5</li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/moneymandoug\">@MoneyManDoug</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/mattl\">@MattL</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/minimalgravitas\">@MinimalGravitas</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/gonna.eth\">@Gonna.eth</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/ethernaut\">@ethernaut</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/butterbum\">@Butterbum</a></li>\n<li>0x1208a26faa0f4ac65b42098419eb4daa5e580ac6</li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/oxytocin\">@Oxytocin</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/opuser\">@OPUser</a></li>\n<li>0x17296956b4e07ff8931e4ff4ea06709fab70b879</li>\n<li>0x5f4bcccb5c2cbb01c619f5cfed555466e31679b6</li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/web3magnetic\">@web3magnetic</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/stablelab\">@StableLab</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"what-does-it-mean-for-delegates-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-does-it-mean-for-delegates-7\"></a>What Does it Mean for Delegates?</h1>\n<p>The proposed amendments to the Anticapture Commission will go to a vote in Special Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#23a</span>.

In future Seasons, the Developer Advisory Board\u2019s mandate may be expanded to assist delegates in assessing technical proposals.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the need for Optimism governance to make good technical decisions, the Foundation is proposing the establishment of a Developer Advisory Board (DAB) with the below mandate.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"developer-advisory-board-charter-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#developer-advisory-board-charter-2\"></a>Developer Advisory Board Charter</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"goals-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#goals-3\"></a>Goals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assess and approve <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/missions-v2-season-5/6897\">Delegate Mission Request</a> drafts based on their technical merits</li>\n<li>Aid the Grants Council in assessing approved<a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/missions-v2-season-5/6897\"> Delegate Mission Requests and Mission Applications</a> under <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents-season-5/6883/2\">Intent #1</a></li>\n<li>Advise the Grants Council in assessing the completion of technical milestones</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"advisory-board-structure-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#advisory-board-structure-4\"></a>Advisory Board Structure</h2>\n<p>This Advisory Board is not a Council as they will serve in an advisory capacity without official decision making authority. Therefore, they will not be elected as representatives, but will rather be appointed. The initial set of members will be appointed by the Foundation. In subsequent Seasons, members will be appointed by the Grants Council.</p>\n<p>The Developer Advisory Board will not vote on proposals. However, the advisory board\u2019s approval will be required on all Delegate Mission Requests under Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span>. In order to provide approvals, a simple majority of advisory board members must agree that an approval has technical merit. Evaluation criteria and rubrics should be made public, when applicable. The Grants Council should also consider the Developer Advisory Board\u2019s input on all Mission Applications under Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"membership-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#membership-5\"></a>Membership</h2>\n<p>The initial Developer Advisory Board will be comprised of six members and a lead, one of which will be a non-voting member of the OP Labs engineering or product team. One member of the Developer Advisory Board will be designated as the Lead to manage general coordination and operations. The Lead will be a non-voting member.  If approved, the Foundation will appoint the below members:</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Board Lead: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brockjelmore\">Brock</a></li>\n<li>Board Member: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/real_philogy\">Philogy</a></li>\n<li>Board Member (forfeiting compensation): <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoahCitron\">Noah</a></li>\n<li>Board Member: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zachobront\">Zach</a></li>\n<li>Board Member: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/r_krasiuk\">Roman </a></li>\n<li>Board Member: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xjepsen\">Jepsen</a></li>\n<li>OP Labs Representative (non-voting): <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter\">Kelvin</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"summary-of-experience-and-qualifications-herehttpsgovoptimismiotdeveloper-advisory-board68927ulavande-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#summary-of-experience-and-qualifications-herehttpsgovoptimismiotdeveloper-advisory-board68927ulavande-6\"></a>Summary of experience and qualifications <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board/6892/7\">here</a></h4>\n<hr>\n<p>All members may be removed from their positions via the Representative Removal proposal type in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md\">Operating Manual</a>.

The initial budget will be important to attract top talent, but we believe the contributions of the Developer Advisory Board are highly conducive to RetroPGF funding and recommend the board be primarily rewarded retroactively.</p>\n<p><strong>Consistent with other reward allocations, all Developer Advisory Board rewards will be subject to a KYC and claims flow process.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"what-does-it-mean-for-delegates-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-does-it-mean-for-delegates-10\"></a>What does it Mean for Delegates?</h1>\n<p>Delegates will need to approve the Developer Advisory Board budget and ratify its membership in Special Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#16a</span>.

This is an important step in the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728\">Path towards Open Metagovernance</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Grants Council will be able to propose Mission Requests under <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104#intent-3-grow-application-devs-on-the-superchain-5\">Intent #3A</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Growth Team of the Foundation will create one Mission Request under <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104#intent-2-bring-chains-to-the-superchain-4\">Intent #3B</a>. This allows the Foundation to temporarily facilitate coordination across Superchain initiatives, one of the Foundation\u2019s most important roles.  In the future, it\u2019s possible that Mission Requests under this Intent may be proposed by OP Chain delegates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Why these changes?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Top 100 delegates will no longer be asked to create <strong>or</strong> approve Mission Request drafts. This dramatically reduces the complexity of the process, the amount of downtime in the grants program, and the potential for builder confusion. For a comprehensive overview of the intensity of the previous Mission Request approval process, please see  SEED LatAm\u2019s <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-participation-and-incentives-season-5-cycle-16-19/7852\">report</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any member of the Feedback Commission and/or Grants Council may still choose to sponsor a Mission Request authored by any member of the community. 13 Mission Requests in Season 5 were sponsored, indicating sponsorship can play an important role in this process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In reality, the majority of Mission Requests were proposed by members of the Grants Council in Season 5, so this doesn\u2019t change a lot in practice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Grants Council must assess Mission Applications and separating the creation and evaluation of Mission Requests, creates a version of the principal-agent problem. The missions v2.5 reduces this dynamic while still balancing power among multiple stakeholders (see <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/DAO-Design-Principles-1a8f325a993948e185adf2fbc553e845?pvs=21\">DAO Design Principles</a>.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All Mission Request drafts will still be voted on by the Token House, meaning all delegates still have the final say over which Mission Requests are supported under each Intent. Mission Requests will be proposed in a rank order, but delegates may override the suggested order by casting votes in any order they choose. This allows delegates to maintain agency while reducing the cognitive overhead and time required.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Grants Council will continue to process all grant applications under each Request in regular 3-6 week cycles throughout the Season.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This process will allow Mission Requests to be rank ordered during the first cycle of the Season (Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#24</span>), reducing downtime in the grants program, an important consideration for growth. Please reference the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-mission-voting-guide/8122/2\">Delegate Mission Voting Guide</a> for details on rank ordering and budgeting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvements will be made to the application process to better optimize the experience for builders and address key pain points that emerged during S5.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Foundation will work closely with the Grants Council to align grants calendars with the governance calendar, ensuring simplicity and understandability of key deadlines and dates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Foundation conducted research on the applicant experience and shared recommendations for designing processes optimized for applicants with the Grants Council.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Developer Advisory will advise the Grants Council on all technical grants and milestones, regardless of the Intent they fall under.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Foundation will advise the Grants Council on all governance Mission Requests, to ensure they correspond to governance roadmaps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The full Season 5 retrospective can be found <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-missions-v2-retrospective/8103/2\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>These changes were directly informed by feedback from delegates, grant applicants, the Grants Council, and the Developer Advisory Board.

This is an important step in the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728\">Path towards Open Metagovernance</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Grants Council will be able to propose Mission Requests under <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104#intent-3-grow-application-devs-on-the-superchain-5\">Intent #3A</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Growth Team of the Foundation will create one Mission Request under <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104#intent-2-bring-chains-to-the-superchain-4\">Intent #3B</a>. This allows the Foundation to temporarily facilitate coordination across Superchain initiatives, one of the Foundation\u2019s most important roles.  In the future, it\u2019s possible that Mission Requests under this Intent may be proposed by OP Chain delegates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Why these changes?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Top 100 delegates will no longer be asked to create <strong>or</strong> approve Mission Request drafts. This dramatically reduces the complexity of the process, the amount of downtime in the grants program, and the potential for builder confusion. For a comprehensive overview of the intensity of the previous Mission Request approval process, please see  SEED LatAm\u2019s <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-participation-and-incentives-season-5-cycle-16-19/7852\">report</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any member of the Feedback Commission and/or Grants Council may still choose to sponsor a Mission Request authored by any member of the community. 13 Mission Requests in Season 5 were sponsored, indicating sponsorship can play an important role in this process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In reality, the majority of Mission Requests were proposed by members of the Grants Council in Season 5, so this doesn\u2019t change a lot in practice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Grants Council must assess Mission Applications and separating the creation and evaluation of Mission Requests, creates a version of the principal-agent problem. The missions v2.5 reduces this dynamic while still balancing power among multiple stakeholders (see <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/DAO-Design-Principles-1a8f325a993948e185adf2fbc553e845?pvs=21\">DAO Design Principles</a>.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All Mission Request drafts will still be voted on by the Token House, meaning all delegates still have the final say over which Mission Requests are supported under each Intent. Mission Requests will be proposed in a rank order, but delegates may override the suggested order by casting votes in any order they choose. This allows delegates to maintain agency while reducing the cognitive overhead and time required.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Grants Council will continue to process all grant applications under each Request in regular 3-6 week cycles throughout the Season.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This process will allow Mission Requests to be rank ordered during the first cycle of the Season (Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#24</span>), reducing downtime in the grants program, an important consideration for growth. Please reference the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-mission-voting-guide/8122/2\">Delegate Mission Voting Guide</a> for details on rank ordering and budgeting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvements will be made to the application process to better optimize the experience for builders and address key pain points that emerged during S5.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Foundation will work closely with the Grants Council to align grants calendars with the governance calendar, ensuring simplicity and understandability of key deadlines and dates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Foundation conducted research on the applicant experience and shared recommendations for designing processes optimized for applicants with the Grants Council.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Developer Advisory will advise the Grants Council on all technical grants and milestones, regardless of the Intent they fall under.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Foundation will advise the Grants Council on all governance Mission Requests, to ensure they correspond to governance roadmaps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The full Season 5 retrospective can be found <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-missions-v2-retrospective/8103/2\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>These changes were directly informed by feedback from delegates, grant applicants, the Grants Council, and the Developer Advisory Board. As always, Missions v2.5 will be treated as an experiment and we\u2019ll collected feedback throughout the process  to make adjustments as needed based on learnings.</p>"}}

However, the Chain Delegation Program is expected to play a meaningful role in our plans to onboard the next ~15 OP Chains. Below we propose an amendment to the original proposal, based on changes that have occurred over the course of Season 5. This program pertains only to L2\u2019s as governance controls protocol parameters at the L2 level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>OP Chains that meet the below criteria will be eligible for 250k OP in delegation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133#superchain-registry-5\">Superchain Registry</a> (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CRXo9YcP9fzJZxmKmEbNcPkZebgpUBMKo63HUhDKy2U/edit#gid=0\">or similar</a>)</li>\n<li>Committed to contribute revenue back to the Collective and generating &gt; 1 ETH / month in sequencer revenue, for at least 2 consecutive months</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additionally, chains the meet the below requirement will be eligible for an additional 750k OP in delegation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1M in transaction volume per month, for at least 2 consecutive months (qualifying Chains will be re-assessed on this metric at the beginning of each Season.) This metric more closely ties to private grant milestones, replacing the previous revenue generation metric (in part due to the impact of 4844).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Chains operating on the Standard Configuration would be eligible for an additional 500k OP in delegation (a total of 1.5M OP for these chains.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Qualifying Chains will be re-assessed on these metrics at the start of each Season.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The size of the program would be increased to 20M, to support the first ~15 OP Chains in their first year of governance participation. All delegation formulas and caps remain the same.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The duration of the program would be extended, to support the first ~15 OP Chains in their first year of governance participation, on a rolling basis until, all qualifying chains have gone through the program.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All delegations made through this program will be capped at the point at which an OP Chain reaches 3M in delegation (including Partner Fund grants able to be delegated), at the time of opt-in.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No delegations have been made through this program to date. Any delegations that are made will be noted as a comment to this forum post.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>OP Chains will not be added to this program until they opt-in and verify they are able to uphold the below participant expectations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>OP Chains must maintain a &gt;70% voting participation rate during the Season, calculated at the start of each Season, or their delegation will be removed at the start of the next Season</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delegates should set an ENS Primary Name to their delegation address and create a delegate statement on <a href=\"http://vote.optimism.io\">vote.optimism.io</a>.

The process by which the Collective takes on more responsibility for the system is iterative, facilitated by the Foundation based on community feedback. The Collective will gradually take on more governance responsibilities over time until the full system is maintained and managed by the Collective.

The Commission mostly formalizes what has to date been an informal process of collecting feedback from high context governance participants.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>About the Commission:</strong> The Commission will include 10 highly engaged Citizens and 15 high context delegates, selected based on qualifying criteria and opt-in requirements, to be published at a later date. The Foundation will request input from the Commission on early design drafts requiring a high degree of context. Commission feedback will be shared with the Foundation and other commission members, but may eventually be viewable by the entire community via a read-only public channel. We will experiment with the Commission for an initial trial period, evaluating its efficacy like any other experiment, using the process outlined above. More details will be posted to the forum shortly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"phase-2-community-directed-design-process-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#phase-2-community-directed-design-process-7\"></a>Phase 2: <strong>Community directed design process</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If continued, the Feedback Commission may evolve into a metaNERD contribution path, that would train and enable metaNERDs to design discrete components of the governance system.

Towards Open Metagovernance Design</h1>\n<p>The Optimism Foundation stewards the development of the Optimism Collective\u2019s governance system. The process by which the Collective takes on more responsibility for the system is iterative, facilitated by the Foundation based on community feedback. The Collective will gradually take on more governance responsibilities over time until the full system is maintained and managed by the Collective. It is at this point the system\u2019s design must be adaptive, with the Foundation just one of many contributors proposing design changes to the system (metagovernance.)</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve heard your feedback regarding more transparency and involvement in the path towards open metagovernance design. This post outlines our current approach to governance design as well as an experimental path to community led metagovernance design.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"overview-of-governance-design-illustrative-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#overview-of-governance-design-illustrative-2\"></a>Overview of Governance Design (Illustrative)</h2>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/28a2d9839e99ca594dee44d925a6ae491055e1d4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/5Nu0a3hOZrWpimTN1lZbZYs8iAk.png?dl=1\" title=\"Untitled\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/28a2d9839e99ca594dee44d925a6ae491055e1d4_2_690x410.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" data-base62-sha1=\"5Nu0a3hOZrWpimTN1lZbZYs8iAk\" width=\"690\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/28a2d9839e99ca594dee44d925a6ae491055e1d4_2_690x410.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/28a2d9839e99ca594dee44d925a6ae491055e1d4_2_1035x615.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/28a2d9839e99ca594dee44d925a6ae491055e1d4_2_1380x820.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FBFBFB\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">Untitled</span><span class=\"informations\">2265\u00d71348 115 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: Based on learnings, community feedback, and/or internal milestones (4), a hypothesis is developed for how a change in governance design could help us further achieve our governance system design goals (to be open sourced at a later date.)\n<ol>\n<li>A hypothesis is informed by a number of factors, including governance goals &amp; design requirements that have been identified following our governance design process (to be open sourced at a later date.)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Experiment</strong>: The hypothesis is tested via a time-bound, and ideally isolated, experiment  (if/when possible).</li>\n<li><strong>Measure &amp; Analyse</strong>: The performance of the experiment is analysed and measured.

The path to open metagovernance will, similarly, occur gradually over multiple phases. The phases outlined below are likely to change in accordance with our design process. Even so, open sourcing this outline is itself an important step towards Phase 1 (below).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"phase-0-current-statecommunity-informed-design-process-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#phase-0-current-statecommunity-informed-design-process-5\"></a><strong>Phase 0 (Current state):Community informed design process</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Optimism Foundation proposes designs based on active input from governance participants, as outlined in the graphic above.\n<ul>\n<li>Examples:  Token House Seasons are designed and iterated on based on delegate feedback. Retroactive Public Goods Funding rounds are designed and iterated on based on Citizen feedback</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Feedback from high context stakeholders occurs informally, usually after designs are complete. Council Leads, top delegates, engaged Citizens, external teams, and/or RetroPGF recipients may be consulted on late stage drafts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"phase-1-community-consulted-design-process-launching-soon-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#phase-1-community-consulted-design-process-launching-soon-6\"></a>Phase 1: <strong>Community consulted design process</strong> (Launching soon!)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>As we open source more of our design principles, process, and goals to the community we begin to build the shared context necessary to move into Phase 1.\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1usz9s8xFme_BjZ6JyQ_U3FLr-VQS1qvc/view?usp=sharing\">ethDenver 2024 presentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/The-Collective-DAO-Archives-dc3659bbebf248ffa56190c0394b7540\">The Collective DAO Archives</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In Phase 1, community feedback will be incorporated <em>during</em> design process, not just after.</li>\n<li>Frequent polls on low context design parameters will be open to any community member\u2019s input.</li>\n<li>Higher context feedback will be requested from a Collective Feedback Commission (CFC.) The Commission mostly formalizes what has to date been an informal process of collecting feedback from high context governance participants.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>About the Commission:</strong> The Commission will include 10 highly engaged Citizens and 15 high context delegates, selected based on qualifying criteria and opt-in requirements, to be published at a later date. The Foundation will request input from the Commission on early design drafts requiring a high degree of context. Commission feedback will be shared with the Foundation and other commission members, but may eventually be viewable by the entire community via a read-only public channel. We will experiment with the Commission for an initial trial period, evaluating its efficacy like any other experiment, using the process outlined above. More details will be posted to the forum shortly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"phase-2-community-directed-design-process-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#phase-2-community-directed-design-process-7\"></a>Phase 2: <strong>Community directed design process</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If continued, the Feedback Commission may evolve into a metaNERD contribution path, that would train and enable metaNERDs to design discrete components of the governance system. Imagine a bounty board of governance design components that can be completed by MetaNERDS.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"phase-3-collaborative-design-process-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#phase-3-collaborative-design-process-8\"></a>Phase 3: <strong>Collaborative design process</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Finally, if successful, the metaNERD contribution path may evolve into a Core Delegate program.</li>\n<li>Core Delegates are our vision for the group of high context governance participants that maintain, contribute to, and evolve the core Optimism governance system, similar to Core Devs, which maintain, contribute to, and evolve the core protocol.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"meta-meta-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#meta-meta-9\"></a>Meta Meta</h3>\n<p>Today is an exciting day for the Collective as we take the first steps towards a more open, and ultimately more collaborative, metagovernance design process.</p>\n<p>As more of the Foundation\u2019s governance design thinking is shared with the community, the shared context necessary to move into Phase 1 is built.

These are some tools that we use, which we wanted to give everyone access to; it doesn\u2019t mean they are the only tools that we should use. As you pointed out, in many cases they can help us avoid failure modes but it will still be up to us to use that as a starting point to build upon as we define what a \u201csuccess mode\u201d would look like.

The concept of a Core Delegate is a longer term vision that will be informed by the things we learn in earlier phases. This is a much longer term plan than we usually share publicly, but that is an important part of Phase 1: open sourcing our design thinking much earlier in the process.

The need for education and patience will be huge as we embark on this road. We shouldn\u2019t underestimate this part.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Absolutely! That\u2019s why this will be a gradual, multi-phase approach that occurs over many months, not a few weeks <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> The idea is to gradually increase the number of high context contributors participating more actively in design while we iteratively refine the process, principles, frameworks, and training we use to facilitate a more collaborative process (all adapted based on contributor input, as always.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Drawing insights from the DAO collective archives and the 12 Design principles highlighted from studying OG DAOs on Ethereum is invaluable. These could serve as a guiding North Star ensuring we don\u2019t repeat past mistakes or reinvent the wheel. But it\u2019s also essential to <strong>remain open to experimentation and innovation</strong> , especially in an era where AI assistance could become a game-changer for DAOs (which was not the case during the early development of those studied daos).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Agree! These are some tools that we use, which we wanted to give everyone access to; it doesn\u2019t mean they are the only tools that we should use. As you pointed out, in many cases they can help us avoid failure modes but it will still be up to us to use that as a starting point to build upon as we define what a \u201csuccess mode\u201d would look like. This will likely require creativity and experimenting with things that haven\u2019t been tried before.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for the panel and Core Delegates, the critical question is how to establish their legitimacy and trust within the broader community. I\u2019m curious to hear about the selection and eligibility criteria.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For now, we\u2019re only focused on Phase 1 and will provide more information on what that looks like shortly. The concept of a Core Delegate is a longer term vision that will be informed by the things we learn in earlier phases. This is a much longer term plan than we usually share publicly, but that is an important part of Phase 1: open sourcing our design thinking much earlier in the process.

This compares to 87% in Season 4 (55% approval rate from original drafts).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Season 5 was the first Season in which rank ordering was relevant, under Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span> and Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3</span> only, as 10 proposals (~25%) received enough votes to meet quorum but weren\u2019t allocated tokens as they would have been over the Intent allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Meanwhile, 25% of the Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> allocation went unallocated while 60% of the Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span> allocation went unallocated. Underallocation can be indicative of many things including lack of ideas, over budgeting, and/or a mismatch between the Governance Fund and the type of work to be supported. In the case of Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span>, we believe the Governance Fund is not the best option to support this type of work given the stage of development of the OP Stack. A smaller allocation for Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span> (now under Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span>) seems appropriate based on demand over the past two Seasons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We received questions on the approval ranking voting mechanism and evaluated how provision of tokens would have changed using a mechanism that optimizes for maximum allocation rather than allocating tokens to only the highest priority initiatives. In short, there was a small portion of tokens unallocated due to the ranking mechanism. There was a larger portion of tokens unallocated due to lack of demand under Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> and Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span>. There was ~2M OP requested that wasn\u2019t provided due to prioritization (in other words, allocation would have been 25% higher had all Mission Requests been allocated tokens.) The mechanism appears to be working as intended, as prioritization is a larger challenge for DAOs than fully allocating resources. DAOs typically struggle to allocate resources <em>sustainably</em>,  under-resourcing core work and over-resourcing non-core work.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/q1I3wC0FZLG2kQE0J5z7YuGutmX.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173_2_690x147.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"q1I3wC0FZLG2kQE0J5z7YuGutmX\" width=\"690\" height=\"147\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173_2_690x147.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECEBE9\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">984\u00d7210 23.5 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We received feedback that one week was not long enough to assess all Mission Requests. In order to reduce the cognitive overhead required of delegates while still maintaining the velocity of Voting Cycles (important for shipping protocol upgrades):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Budget information will be displayed on the voting interface</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A dynamic spreadsheet will be provided to assess the impact of different rank orderings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Collective Feedback Commission and Grants Council will propose Mission Requests in a suggested rank order, which delegates can either replicate or override based on their own preferences</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We received some delegate feedback on adjusting the quorum lower. It is currently set to 51% of the 30% quorum (~13.5M OP.) If there is a strong argument that an exception needs to be made to set quorum lower for Mission Requests than on all other proposal types, suggested changes will be considered. However, since there were only 5 Mission Requests that failed to reach quorum (12% of total), it doesn\u2019t appear that this is a significant barrier and the current plan is not to change the quorum in Season 6.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have updated the voting guide to make the mechanism clearer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-mission-voting-guide/8122\"><strong>Mission Request Voting Guide</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Applying to Mission Requests</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Grants Council processed grants in two cycles during Season 5. We received feedback that this was too slow and, therefore, frustrating for applicants. In Season 6, applications should be processed every 3-6 weeks, on a rolling submission basis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Grants Council received 314 applications in the first cycle of grants, relative to a comparable 376 proposals in all of Season 4. This demand was partially due to the nearly three month downtime between grant application processes which created a large application backlog, another reason it\u2019s important to limit downtime between grants cycles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However, the Grants Council also received 234 applications in the second grants cycle, indicating strong and persistent demand for Governance Fund grants.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Foundation conducted grant applicant research, identifying many areas for process improvement, which have been shared with the Grants Council and should inform Season 6 operations. Some of these suggestions are included below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There was a lot confusion stemming from a misalignment in governance and grants calendars. Applicants should only need to reference one calendar in Season 6, and there should be no periods of overlapping deadlines. Start dates, deadlines, and decision dates will be made clear from the start of the Season.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We need to improve the discoverability of key application information, streamlining and simplifying communications on one platform and ensuring communications are consistent between the Foundation and the Grants Council.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The need for applicants to understand the difference between builders and growth grants should be eliminated as all applicants may now submit hybrid applications.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Selecting Mission Applications</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In the first grants cycle, 13% of all applications were approved. In the second grants cycle, 24.5% of all applications were approved.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This was the first Season the Developer Advisory Board was available to provide feedback to the Grants Council on grant applications under Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span>. DAB feedback was helpful, but requested too late in the process during the first grants cycle. The DAB has adjusted its internal operations to make their final recommendations more useful to the Grants Council. You can see the DAB retrospective <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-retrospective-season-5/8084\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tracking Milestones</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>This Season there was a dedicated committee to track completion of Milestones.  This committee evaluated +300 milestones throughout Season 5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cycle 10 was the first cycle of grants co complete the one year lock-up. No grants were clawed back! Cycle 11 had two applicants withdraw their applications and one of those applicants resubmitted a new grant application. All other grants successfully completed their milestones.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The concept of benchmark milestones, in addition to critical milestones, may be eliminated in Season 6 as they caused confusion among applicants.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional areas for improvement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There were some Mission Requests that didn\u2019t receive competitive applications, in terms of either number or quality. This could be due to overly narrow or broad scoping of a Mission Request or the need to drive quality applicants to our grants program. <strong>Efforts to drive quality applications will be important to the success of Season 6.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>In short, we learned a ton from Season 5 and Missions v2!

In short, there was a small portion of tokens unallocated due to the ranking mechanism. There was a larger portion of tokens unallocated due to lack of demand under Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> and Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span>. There was ~2M OP requested that wasn\u2019t provided due to prioritization (in other words, allocation would have been 25% higher had all Mission Requests been allocated tokens.) The mechanism appears to be working as intended, as prioritization is a larger challenge for DAOs than fully allocating resources. DAOs typically struggle to allocate resources <em>sustainably</em>,  under-resourcing core work and over-resourcing non-core work.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/q1I3wC0FZLG2kQE0J5z7YuGutmX.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173_2_690x147.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"q1I3wC0FZLG2kQE0J5z7YuGutmX\" width=\"690\" height=\"147\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173_2_690x147.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECEBE9\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">984\u00d7210 23.5 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We received feedback that one week was not long enough to assess all Mission Requests. In order to reduce the cognitive overhead required of delegates while still maintaining the velocity of Voting Cycles (important for shipping protocol upgrades):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Budget information will be displayed on the voting interface</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A dynamic spreadsheet will be provided to assess the impact of different rank orderings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Collective Feedback Commission and Grants Council will propose Mission Requests in a suggested rank order, which delegates can either replicate or override based on their own preferences</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We received some delegate feedback on adjusting the quorum lower. It is currently set to 51% of the 30% quorum (~13.5M OP.) If there is a strong argument that an exception needs to be made to set quorum lower for Mission Requests than on all other proposal types, suggested changes will be considered. However, since there were only 5 Mission Requests that failed to reach quorum (12% of total), it doesn\u2019t appear that this is a significant barrier and the current plan is not to change the quorum in Season 6.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have updated the voting guide to make the mechanism clearer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-mission-voting-guide/8122\"><strong>Mission Request Voting Guide</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Applying to Mission Requests</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Grants Council processed grants in two cycles during Season 5. We received feedback that this was too slow and, therefore, frustrating for applicants. In Season 6, applications should be processed every 3-6 weeks, on a rolling submission basis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Grants Council received 314 applications in the first cycle of grants, relative to a comparable 376 proposals in all of Season 4. This demand was partially due to the nearly three month downtime between grant application processes which created a large application backlog, another reason it\u2019s important to limit downtime between grants cycles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However, the Grants Council also received 234 applications in the second grants cycle, indicating strong and persistent demand for Governance Fund grants.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Foundation conducted grant applicant research, identifying many areas for process improvement, which have been shared with the Grants Council and should inform Season 6 operations. Some of these suggestions are included below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There was a lot confusion stemming from a misalignment in governance and grants calendars. Applicants should only need to reference one calendar in Season 6, and there should be no periods of overlapping deadlines. Start dates, deadlines, and decision dates will be made clear from the start of the Season.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We need to improve the discoverability of key application information, streamlining and simplifying communications on one platform and ensuring communications are consistent between the Foundation and the Grants Council.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The need for applicants to understand the difference between builders and growth grants should be eliminated as all applicants may now submit hybrid applications.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Selecting Mission Applications</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In the first grants cycle, 13% of all applications were approved. In the second grants cycle, 24.5% of all applications were approved.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This was the first Season the Developer Advisory Board was available to provide feedback to the Grants Council on grant applications under Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span>. DAB feedback was helpful, but requested too late in the process during the first grants cycle. The DAB has adjusted its internal operations to make their final recommendations more useful to the Grants Council. You can see the DAB retrospective <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-retrospective-season-5/8084\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tracking Milestones</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>This Season there was a dedicated committee to track completion of Milestones.  This committee evaluated +300 milestones throughout Season 5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cycle 10 was the first cycle of grants co complete the one year lock-up. No grants were clawed back! Cycle 11 had two applicants withdraw their applications and one of those applicants resubmitted a new grant application. All other grants successfully completed their milestones.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The concept of benchmark milestones, in addition to critical milestones, may be eliminated in Season 6 as they caused confusion among applicants.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional areas for improvement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There were some Mission Requests that didn\u2019t receive competitive applications, in terms of either number or quality. This could be due to overly narrow or broad scoping of a Mission Request or the need to drive quality applicants to our grants program. <strong>Efforts to drive quality applications will be important to the success of Season 6.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>In short, we learned a ton from Season 5 and Missions v2! Thank you to everyone who participated in this iterative process. Much of your feedback and many of these learnings have been incorporated in the design of <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-missions-v2-5/8106/2\">Missions v2.5</a>.</p>"}}

The process by which the Collective takes on more responsibility for the system is iterative, and facilitated by the Foundation, based on community feedback. The Collective will gradually take on more governance responsibilities over time until the full system is maintained and managed by the Collective. It is at this point that the Foundation becomes just one of many \u201cCore Delegates\u201d proposing design changes to the system (metagovernance).</p>\n<p>As outlined in <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728/2\">The Path to Open Metagovernance,</a> the path to open metagovernance will occur gradually over multiple phases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To date, we\u2019ve been primarily in <strong>Phase 0: community informed design.</strong> The Optimism Foundation open-sources our internal research and proposes designs based on active feedback from governance participants.

The Commission mostly formalizes what has, to date, been an informal process of collecting feedback from high context governance participants such as Council Leads, top delegates, engaged Citizens, external teams, and Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) recipients.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Please note all existing avenues for community feedback will remain in place, allowing any member of the community to share their input for incorporation by the Foundation, as always.

The process by which the Collective takes on more responsibility for the system is iterative, and facilitated by the Foundation, based on community feedback. The Collective will gradually take on more governance responsibilities over time until the full system is maintained and managed by the Collective. It is at this point that the Foundation becomes just one of many \u201cCore Delegates\u201d proposing design changes to the system (metagovernance).</p>\n<p>As outlined in <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728/2\">The Path to Open Metagovernance,</a> the path to open metagovernance will occur gradually over multiple phases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To date, we\u2019ve been primarily in <strong>Phase 0: community informed design.</strong> The Optimism Foundation open-sources our internal research and proposes designs based on active feedback from governance participants. We receive feedback on late-stage drafts from high-context stakeholders informally, usually after designs are complete.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now we are ready to start entering <strong>Phase 1: Community consulted design process.</strong> That means will we continue open-sourcing more of our design principles, process, and goals to the community to build shared context while also consulting community members earlier in the design process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will do this via two primary mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Frequent polls on low-context design parameters, open to any community member\u2019s input.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Higher context feedback requested of an experimental Collective Feedback Commission. The Commission mostly formalizes what has, to date, been an informal process of collecting feedback from high context governance participants such as Council Leads, top delegates, engaged Citizens, external teams, and Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) recipients.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Please note all existing avenues for community feedback will remain in place, allowing any member of the community to share their input for incorporation by the Foundation, as always. The goal of Phase 1 is to bring more people into the design process, not keep anybody out. The Feedback Commission is an addition to the existing feedback channels, not a replacement for any of them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"collective-feedback-commission-cfc-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#collective-feedback-commission-cfc-2\"></a>Collective Feedback Commission (CFC)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Collective Feedback Commission will consult the Foundation on early design drafts requiring a high degree of context.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Collective Feedback Commission will include 10 highly engaged Citizens and 15 high-context delegates, selected based on the qualifying criteria outlined below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>10 highly engaged Citizens have been selected based on their contributions, specifically as they relate to governance design, in Retro Funding Rounds 2 &amp; 3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth\">Carl Cervone</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/ccerv1\">@ccerv1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/launamu.eth\">LauNaMu</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/launamu\">@LauNaMu</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/MMPx9GNZ0mHXgMsTuOmBsmpBnLt31faqIayrD2R1EGs\">Spencer</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/spengrah\">@spengrah</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/lefteris-rpgf-3-voting-rationale-learnings-and-feedback/7213\">Lefteris</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/lefterisjp\">@lefterisjp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@msteph/ByG23qs2T\">Matt Stephenson</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/joans-rpgf3-reflections/7221\">Joan</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/joanbp\">@joanbp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/simulating-retropgf3-voting-and-funding-allocations/7274\">Amy Jung</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/amy\">@amy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/revs-rpgf3-retro/7290\">Rev Miller</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/revmiller\">@revmiller</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03530\">Sarah Allen</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/saraha\">@saraha</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-3-feedback-thread/6177/151\">Griff Green</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/griff\">@Griff</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All (Season 5) Council/Board/Commission Leads qualify to participate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alisha.eth <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/alisha.eth\">@alisha.eth</a></li>\n<li>Teresa <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/teresacd\">@teresacd</a></li>\n<li>Brichis.eth <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/brichis\">@brichis</a></li>\n<li>Gonna.eth <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/gonna.eth\">@Gonna.eth</a></li>\n<li>Brock <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/brockelmore\">@brockelmore</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The top 10 disclosed Token House delegates, as per Agora on 3/6/23 (end of Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#19</span>) qualify to participate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/a16zs-continued-participation-in-optimism-governance/7562\">a16z</a></li>\n<li>L2BEATs <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/kaereste\">@kaereste</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/sinkas\">@Sinkas</a></li>\n<li>Linda Xie <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/linda\">@linda</a></li>\n<li>Polynya <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/polynya\">@polynya</a></li>\n<li>Olimpio <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/olimpio\">@olimpio</a></li>\n<li>GFX Labs <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/gfxlabs\">@GFXlabs</a></li>\n<li>Lefteris <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/lefterisjp\">@lefterisjp</a></li>\n<li>SNX Ambassadors <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/mattl\">@MattL</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/mastermojo\">@mastermojo</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/moneymandoug\">@MoneyManDoug</a></li>\n<li>Scott Moore <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/ceresstation\">@ceresstation</a></li>\n<li>Jack Anorak <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/jackanorak\">@jackanorak</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"how-it-works-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#how-it-works-3\"></a>How it Works</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All CFC members must opt-in to participate.</strong> Any open positions as a result of someone choosing not to opt-in will remain unfilled.

We\u2019re reposting here in full for feedback and discussion from the community.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1><a name=\"the-future-of-optimism-governance-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#the-future-of-optimism-governance-1\"></a>The Future of Optimism Governance</h1>\n<p>The Optimism Collective is governed by a two-house system. The Token House is made up of OP holders and their delegates, and the Citizens\u2019 House is a one-person-one-vote system based on reputation.</p>\n<p>This two-house design is intended to help the Collective make good decisions and avoid common pitfalls in token-based governance systems. Tokenholders represent one constituency out of many, and are not always the right unilateral owners for decisions that don\u2019t involve the economics of the system. Creating two distinct branches of governance with different membership criteria allows the Collective to match constituents\u2019 incentives with different types of decisions. It also helps the Collective avoid concentration of power, enact safeguards via checks and balances, and evaluate decisions from broader perspectives.</p>\n<p>This is not a new concept. Bi- or tri-cameral governance systems have existed for centuries. With a new iteration of a known pattern, Optimism aims to build a governance system that will stand the test of time and help the Collective flourish.</p>\n<p>This post provides an overview of the goals, design principles, and problem spaces of Optimism Governance. It is not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance processes will be introduced and implemented: it\u2019s highly likely the Collective will learn from initial experiments and make modifications to the rules and processes outlined here. These \u201cProblem Spaces\u201d are intended as starting points for discussion.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"governance-goals-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#governance-goals-2\"></a>Governance Goals</h2>\n<p>There are two primary goals of Optimism\u2019s governance system:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Capture resistance.</strong> Governance plays a key role in securing the anti-capture and censorship resistance of the Optimism protocol. Governance should (a) make it possible for chain or network operation to continue without reliance on any individual entity, and (b) prevent any one entity or small group of entities from being able to control or censor the protocol or its functions.</li>\n<li><strong>Resource allocation.</strong> Governance\u2019s second primary responsibility is to allocate resources effectively to support the Collective\u2019s vision and accrue sustainable value to the Optimism Collective. Vision &amp; value may often be in conflict, and allocating resources effectively involves a blend of short- and long-term thinking. This includes allocation of both the token treasury and protocol revenue.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"design-principles-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#design-principles-3\"></a>Design Principles</h2>\n<p>Design decisions for the Collective\u2019s governance system should be made in line with three key principles:</p>\n<p><strong>Governance minimization</strong>. The set of governance responsibilities that are encoded onchain or formalized in voting processes should remain as minimal as possible. The Collective aims to reduce governance to its essence and to avoid introducing regulation where freedom can achieve the same result. This principle is key to encouraging permissionless innovation. In practice, this looks like a minimal set of (1) onchain governance processes to upgrade Optimism contracts and tune the economic parameters of the system, and (2) offchain social processes to maintain a healthy community.</p>\n<p><strong>Iteration</strong>. Optimism is decentralizing iteratively to increase the chances of building a healthy system that lasts for the long-term. This means the Foundation will play a role in establishing processes, help the Collective through its first few rapid feedback loops in improving those processes, then reduce its role over time. (This also means the design principles and goals outlined in this document may be invalidated or updated along the way.) This iteration gives the Collective a chance to learn how to make thoughtful decisions using an un-intuitive but essential loop: introduce a governance process that involves active participation, then gradually work to automate or minimize it over time. Governance\u2019s responsibility then becomes to adjust the autopilot when necessary, not to keep two hands on the wheel.</p>\n<p><strong>Forking</strong>. The right to fork and the right to exit are critical to protect individual freedoms. All of the core software and tooling required to run the Optimism network should be made open source, freely available, and easy to use such that a fork is always a viable alternative. This isn\u2019t just about vibes: in crypto, where credible commitments not to extract are <a href=\"https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/when-is-decentralizing-on-a-blockchain-valuable/\">what makes decentralized platforms valuable</a>, this is a competitive advantage. Participants will be more likely to join Optimism if they have the ability to make an alternative.</p>\n<p><strong>Balance</strong>. Influence in governance must extend beyond financial stake to value humanhood and intelligent life. The centralizing force of plutocratic token governance must be balanced with Citizenship. Giving voice and power to different constituents allows the Collective to match decisions with voters\u2019 incentives, rather than building a solely plutocratic system. Checks and balances prevent capture.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact = profit.</strong> A key part of the Optimistic Vision is to ensure that every individual is rewarded in proportion to their positive impact to the Collective. We believe this to be the most important target in the pursuit of solving global coordination problems and creating a better future. Our economy is an expression of our collective needs, wants, and ethics. Optimism Governance is ultimately responsible for enacting this fairness ratio that is key to the Optimistic Vision.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"design-overview-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#design-overview-4\"></a>Design Overview</h2>\n<p>The responsibilities of Optimism Governance can be categorized into one of the two primary goals of the governance system: <strong>Capture Resistance</strong> and <strong>Resource Allocation</strong>. Within each category, governance responsibilities are identified as (a) the exclusive responsibility of one or the other house, (b) a responsibility where one house drives proposals and the other house may veto, or (c) as a truly shared responsibility subject to approval by each house. This system is designed to help each house play to its strengths and avoid deadlock.</p>\n<p>The Optimism <strong>Token House</strong> is made up of OP tokenholders and their delegates. Tokenholders and their delegates are expected to be rational economic actors interested in preserving or increasing the economic well-being of the Optimism Collective. Therefore, the Token House is responsible for decisions that affect business parameters of the system such as inflation or the variables that govern sequencer selection. Token voting is distributed widely and permissionlessly and helps represent the free market in the Collective\u2019s decision making.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the Token House, the <strong>Citizens\u2019 House</strong> uses a one-person, one-vote system. Citizens are meant to represent individual human stakeholders of the Collective: builders, users, and community members who are aligned with the project\u2019s values and are interested in the long-term benefit of the Collective. Therefore, the Citizens\u2019 House is responsible for decisions that may require prioritizing long term growth ahead of other goals \u2013 decisions like allocating funding to public goods that support the Collective. In the long term, we can expect the Citizens\u2019 House to expand to include the thousands or millions or billions of humans interacting with Optimism.</p>\n<p>Governance responsibilities given to each house will change over time as the Collective iterates towards its long-term governance-minimized end state. This includes introducing highly manual governance responsibilities (e.g. inflation adjustments, or Superchain allowlists) that are intended to be replaced by automated smart defaults as the Collective learns how to govern these vectors appropriately. It may also include transitioning powers from the responsibility of the full governance body to a subset of governance participants who are empowered by their broader governance base.</p>\n<p>In these early chapters of Collective governance, many of these iterations have been designed or implemented by the Optimism Foundation. Eventually this must transition to the responsibility of Collective governance itself. This meta-governance power marks the end of the Foundation\u2019s stewardship of the evolution of Collective governance and entrusts the governance community with continued experimentation towards a healthy end-state for Optimism.</p>\n<p>So: what does governance\u2026 well, govern?</p>\n<h2><a name=\"problem-space-1-capture-resistance-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#problem-space-1-capture-resistance-5\"></a><strong>Problem Space <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1:</span> Capture Resistance</strong></h2>\n<p>Optimism Governance\u2019s first responsibility is to ensure that no single party can unilaterally control, censor, halt, or otherwise extract rent from Optimism. A decentralized compute layer is hardly valuable if controlled by a centralized entity. Governance helps the Collective make decisions in the absence of any one person or organization that is \u201cin charge.\u201d</p>\n<p>The responsibility to uphold capture resistance can be broken down into two broad categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>hard powers:</strong> governance powers that are eventually encoded and executed onchain, and</li>\n<li><strong>soft powers:</strong> social norms the governance community upholds, not enforced onchain but by the community\u2019s ability to fork.<br>\n<br></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>1/ Hard powers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Protocol Upgrades</strong> refer to the ability for governance to make changes to the OP Stack protocol itself. This is a crucial responsibility of governance that ultimately makes the community the steward of Optimism\u2019s core protocol functionality.</p>\n<p>Protocol upgrades will be approved by the Token House, subject to a Citizens\u2019 House veto. The Token House is the primary approver because of its broad reach and likelihood of representing business interests that depend on the OP Stack\u2019s functionality. The Citizens\u2019 House veto power guards against capture of the Token House and increases the resilience of the overall system.</p>\n<p>Today, protocol upgrades are approved by the Token House and executed manually by the Optimism Foundation. In the coming Seasons, the Collective may implement a Security Council responsible for executing upgrades following the will of governance. The Citizens\u2019 House veto power comes online in Season 5 (H1 2023), when the Citizens\u2019 House comes fully online. Eventually, execution of protocol upgrades will be fully onchain. On a far enough time horizon, we can expect protocol upgrades to become less and less common as the protocol nears feature completeness. We can look to protocols like Ethereum and Bitcoin as a model for what mature decentralized protocol upgrades look like.</p>\n<p><strong>Sequencer Selection</strong> is the ability to make choices about which parties may act as sequencers for OP Chains or in shared sequencing schemes.</p>\n<p>This begins as an explicit governance power driven by the Token House, with Citizens\u2019 House power to veto. Sequencers are important economic actors for OP Chains and eventually for the Superchain. The Token House is well-incentivized to make sure sequencer selection is fair and beneficial for the Collective. The Citizens\u2019 House veto power guards against the capture of the Token House related to sequencer selection.</p>\n<p>Today, OP Chains are sequenced by a handful of different entities. In Season 5, those sequencers will submit proposals to Optimism Governance to be formally included in the Superchain, officially bringing the hard power of sequencer selection into the hands of the Collective. More information about this governance process will be shared in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Eventually, sequencer selection may be fully automated based on verifiable and pre-agreed upon processes, enabling the sequencer set to be curated and maintained without active governance intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Citizenship Eligibility</strong> is the responsibility of governance to select new humans to participate in the Citizens\u2019 House of Optimism Governance.</p>\n<p>Citizenship Eligibility will be determined by the Citizens\u2019 House; the Token House will have the power to veto. Assuming good long-term values alignment with the Collective, Citizens should be incentivized to grow a set of voters that make quality decisions about RetroPGF allocations. A Token House veto guards against capture of the Citizens\u2019 House or moves to consolidate power.</p>\n<p>To date, Citizenship expansion has been administered by the Foundation. In the future, the Foundation will propose an expansion algorithm that Citizens vote to approve. Ultimately, Citizens may govern a citizenship selection algorithm directly that runs across identity data in the Optimism AttestationStation. In its final minimized form, the Citizens\u2019 House has established a battle-tested onchain selection process; updates to the contracts that govern selection can be made as necessary by the Citizens\u2019 House.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>2/ Soft powers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Code of Conduct Enforcement</strong> is the responsibility of governance to uphold and enforce the Optimism Collective Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>Each house may govern the code of conduct for its own members. The best cultural and values-based enforcement for governance communities should come from within that specific community.</p>\n<p>Today, CoC violations are processed with administration from the Foundation. In future Seasons, the community will iterate on this approach: Season 4 includes an <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2\">RFP for Code of Conduct research</a>, and Season 6 may introduce a new Council to replace the Foundation\u2019s role in this process. As a soft power, Code of Conduct enforcement will not be implemented onchain. For example, if a Token House delegate were to violate the Code of Conduct, that delegate would not be prevented from voting by an update to Optimism\u2019s voting contracts onchain. Rather, the community could enforce its rules and norms on the social layer by choosing to remove the participant from delegation frontends and UIs, or by informing the tokenholders who\u2019ve delegated to the offending party of the breach in conduct.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Removal</strong> is the right of governance to remove a director of the Optimism Foundation. Director Removals are approved by the Token House.</p>\n<p>This right is enforced and upheld by the Founding Documents of the Optimism Collective. As such, the Token House may vote to veto any reduction of this power. As Directors are not represented onchain, this responsibility does not have onchain enforceability.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"problem-space-2-resource-allocation-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#problem-space-2-resource-allocation-6\"></a><strong>Problem Space <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2:</span> Resource Allocation</strong></h2>\n<p>The second primary responsibility of Optimism governance is to allocate the Collective\u2019s resources to help it achieve its goals. This is a piece of essential governance that requires human intervention, especially in its early stages. Resource allocation in the Collective comes in three forms:</p>\n<p><strong>1/ Allocation of Protocol Revenue</strong><br>\n<strong>2/ OP Treasury Management</strong><br>\n<strong>3/ RetroPGF Funding</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Allocation of Protocol Revenue</strong> is the responsibility of governance to determine how to direct surplus ETH generated by the Optimism protocol. Optimism generates revenue through transaction fees paid on OP Mainnet and other OP Chains. Part of these transaction fees is used to post data to Ethereum L1 and pay for other expenses associated with running the protocol, and the remainder of the fee is accumulated as surplus revenue that can be directed by the Collective for the benefit of the Collective. In the future, the sequencing and proving networks that help run the Optimism protocol may also provide sources of revenue for the Collective.</p>\n<p>By default, surplus protocol revenue will be allocated to RetroPGF. The Token House may vote on proposals to divert a portion of the surplus protocol revenue for other Optimism Collective purposes as they see fit. These proposals will be subject to veto right by the Citizens\u2019 House.</p>\n<p>Protocol Revenue is a crucial lever in the Collective. In its early stages, the default allocation to RetroPGF lets the Collective reward projects that grow the Optimism ecosystem. As Optimism matures, the Token House is entrusted to propose deviations from this default for the health of the Optimism Collective. Citizens\u2019 House veto powers help hold the Token House accountable and prevent short term optimization at the expense of long term sustainability.</p>\n<p>In a future governance season, a proposal type will be introduced for proposing modifications to the allocation of surplus protocol revenue. These proposals may begin with certain safeguards, like a cap on possible allocations. Proposal power for high-level budgeting decisions may additionally be delegated to elected representatives as the Token House sees fit. The long term minimized state of this governance responsibility could include some thoughtful automation to determine revenue allocations based on indicators of whether the Collective should be in a \u201cgrowth\u201d stage or \u201cvalue\u201d stage.</p>\n<p><strong>OP Treasury Allocation</strong> is the responsibility of governance to direct how the existing OP token treasury is allocated. This has several components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <strong>Governance Fund</strong>, which is directed by Token House governance.</li>\n<li>The <strong>RetroPGF Fund</strong>, which is directed by Citizens\u2019 House governance, subject to a Token House veto.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Seed Fund</strong> and <strong>Unallocated</strong> portions of the token treasury, which are initially administered by the Foundation, and will eventually be directed jointly by both houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Foundation Budget Approvals</strong>, which are governed jointly by both houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Inflation adjustments</strong>, which are governed by the Token House, subject to a Citizens\u2019 House veto.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This distributed ownership of the OP Treasury allows for flexibility and gives each house a clear mechanism to allocate tokens for the development of the Collective. Today, treasury allocations are administered by the Foundation, and will gradually move onchain as the governance system matures and becomes more resilient. In the long term, as most of the Treasury is circulating, this power will boil down to the governance of inflation, which can be automated to a thoughtful set of defaults based on the economic health of the Collective.</p>\n<p><strong>RetroPGF Grants</strong> are the responsibility of governance to allocate RetroPGF to projects that have provided public good to the Optimism Collective. These grants may refer to either (a) OP tokens from the RetroPGF Fund portion of the token treasury (see OP Treasury Allocation), or (b) Profits generated by the Optimism Protocol that governance has decided to allocate to RetroPGF (see Allocation of Protocol Revenue). Specifically, this responsibility includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>RetroPGF Scope</strong>: the ability of governance to update the scope, metrics, and impact evaluation criteria used in determining how RetroPGF Grants are allocated to projects. In line with the principle of governance minimization, this should be a soft power.</li>\n<li><strong>Project Allocations</strong>: the ability of the Citizens\u2019 House to make specific individual project-level decisions about how the RetroPGF Scope is applied to allocate grants. This is the corresponding hard power for RetroPGF.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both components of RetroPGF Grants above are the responsibility of the Citizens\u2019 House. Citizens are selected as individual humans who are interested in the long term health of the Optimism Collective, and RetroPGF is a long term investment in Optimism\u2019s growth.</p>\n<p>Today, the Foundation identifies RetroPGF scope and Citizens make Project Allocation decisions. Eventually, Citizens will govern RetroPGF scope themselves.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Altogether, this looks like the diagram below:</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/caEzKbwfX1MMuFTjinRTEdM3vVD.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_690x345.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"caEzKbwfX1MMuFTjinRTEdM3vVD\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_690x345.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_1035x517.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_1380x690.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"23212B\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\"></span><span class=\"informations\">3840\u00d71921 572 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<h2><a name=\"additional-notes-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#additional-notes-7\"></a>Additional Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Incompleteness</strong></p>\n<p>The list above does not include all governance powers \u2013 it notably excludes governance responsibilities, especially social ones.</p>\n<p>The list above is also not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance powers will be rolled out and implemented. It is highly likely that the Collective will learn from initial experiments towards this blueprint and may make modifications to the processes outlined here. These \u201cProblem Spaces\u201d are intended as starting points for discussion, not as a prescriptive roadmap.</p>\n<p><strong>Checks, balances, and vetos</strong></p>\n<p>This post also excludes crucial design details about veto power, approval and quorum thresholds, proposal defaults, and failure modes. In particular, it\u2019s important to note that all veto powers are not created equal. A very high veto threshold and quorum create a higher bar for exercising veto power, where a simple majority could make for a relatively easy veto. These thresholds determine the balance of power in responsibilities shared between houses and must be considered carefully.</p>\n<p>The Collective will apply the principle of iteration in introducing these checks, balances, and vetos. This allows time to experiment with the right settings and make sure both branches of governance are developing safely.</p>\n<p>These details are incredibly important to the design of a well-functioning system, and members of the Collective are consulting with a set of experts, from crypto and beyond, to design a quality set of patterns to increase the chances of Optimism Governance\u2019s success. If you\u2019re interested in contributing to these efforts, you\u2019re welcome to reach out to <a href=\"http://mailto:bobby@optimism.io/\">bobby@optimism.io</a> or chime in on the governance forums.</p>\n<p><strong>Citizenship and capture</strong></p>\n<p>Since Citizens play a crucial role in the Optimism governance, it\u2019s paramount that the Citizens\u2019 House is qualified and capture-resistant. Several factors come into play here, including the ways identity and contribution history can help inform citizenship eligibility; public and private voting strategies to help prevent collusion and bribery; citizenship incentives; escape hatches and metagovernance in the event of capture; and the iterative path towards growing the set of Citizens and their responsibilities. These important topics will be discussed in greater detail in a future post.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-milestones-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#key-milestones-8\"></a>Key Milestones</h1>\n<p>Optimism Governance continues to make steady strides towards a robust and sustainable system. Here are some of the next milestones for the Collective in the coming quarters:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"season-5-2024-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#season-5-2024-9\"></a><strong>Season 5 [2024]</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sequencer Allowlist / Law of Chains</strong><br>\nSeason 5 will introduce the governance system\u2019s power to welcome new Sequencers into the Superchain. More information about sequencer governance (and its relation to chain, user, and platform governance) will be shared in the coming weeks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Joint-House voting</strong><br>\nIn Season 5, the Collective will bring the Citizens\u2019 House fully online and execute its first set of joint-house votes. After executing three rounds of RetroPGF, this milestone will mark the next stage of maturity for the Citizens\u2019 House as they participate in Optimism Governance beyond RetroPGF grant allocations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Security Council v1</strong><br>\nSeason 5 will also include the Optimism Security Council. The Security Council is a set of community members tasked with executing protocol upgrades at the will of governance. This replaces the multisig wallet controlled by the Optimism Foundation and marks an important milestone in protocol decentralization.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"season-6-2024-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#season-6-2024-10\"></a><strong>Season 6 [2024]</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Protocol Revenue Allocation</strong><br>\nSeason 6 will introduce the initial process for votes to allocate Protocol Revenue. It\u2019s possible this process will include the introduction of a Treasury Council responsible for making high-level proposals to governance about how to allocate resources; any proposal for protocol revenue allocation will be submitted to the Token House for approval, and to the Citizens\u2019 House for veto.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Onchain treasury execution</strong><br>\nIn Season 6, parts of the Optimism Treasury will move onchain. This means governance will be able to initiate transactions that move tokens from the OP Token Treasury entirely onchain. As noted above, this onchain execution will begin with an emergency safeguard that will be removed in future seasons.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>", "post_number": 1, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2023-08-08T19:54:25.272Z", "reply_count": 3, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 222, "reads": 192, "readers_count": 191, "score": 1673.4, "yours": false, "topic_id": 6471, "topic_slug": "the-future-of-optimism-governance", "display_username": "bobby", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "flair_group_id": null, "version": 4, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "link_counts": [{"url": "https://optimism.mirror.xyz/PLrAQgE1EGRo7GRrFoztplFChnUZda4DFGW3dkQayxY", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "title": "The Future of Optimism Governance \u2014 The Optimism Collective", "clicks": 32}, {"url": "https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/when-is-decentralizing-on-a-blockchain-valuable/", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "title": "When is decentralizing on a blockchain valuable?

The Token House is made up of OP holders and their delegates, and the Citizens\u2019 House is a one-person-one-vote system based on reputation.</p>\n<p>This two-house design is intended to help the Collective make good decisions and avoid common pitfalls in token-based governance systems. Tokenholders represent one constituency out of many, and are not always the right unilateral owners for decisions that don\u2019t involve the economics of the system. Creating two distinct branches of governance with different membership criteria allows the Collective to match constituents\u2019 incentives with different types of decisions. It also helps the Collective avoid concentration of power, enact safeguards via checks and balances, and evaluate decisions from broader perspectives.</p>\n<p>This is not a new concept. Bi- or tri-cameral governance systems have existed for centuries. With a new iteration of a known pattern, Optimism aims to build a governance system that will stand the test of time and help the Collective flourish.</p>\n<p>This post provides an overview of the goals, design principles, and problem spaces of Optimism Governance. It is not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance processes will be introduced and implemented: it\u2019s highly likely the Collective will learn from initial experiments and make modifications to the rules and processes outlined here. These \u201cProblem Spaces\u201d are intended as starting points for discussion.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"governance-goals-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#governance-goals-2\"></a>Governance Goals</h2>\n<p>There are two primary goals of Optimism\u2019s governance system:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Capture resistance.</strong> Governance plays a key role in securing the anti-capture and censorship resistance of the Optimism protocol. Governance should (a) make it possible for chain or network operation to continue without reliance on any individual entity, and (b) prevent any one entity or small group of entities from being able to control or censor the protocol or its functions.</li>\n<li><strong>Resource allocation.</strong> Governance\u2019s second primary responsibility is to allocate resources effectively to support the Collective\u2019s vision and accrue sustainable value to the Optimism Collective. Vision &amp; value may often be in conflict, and allocating resources effectively involves a blend of short- and long-term thinking. This includes allocation of both the token treasury and protocol revenue.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"design-principles-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#design-principles-3\"></a>Design Principles</h2>\n<p>Design decisions for the Collective\u2019s governance system should be made in line with three key principles:</p>\n<p><strong>Governance minimization</strong>. The set of governance responsibilities that are encoded onchain or formalized in voting processes should remain as minimal as possible. The Collective aims to reduce governance to its essence and to avoid introducing regulation where freedom can achieve the same result. This principle is key to encouraging permissionless innovation. In practice, this looks like a minimal set of (1) onchain governance processes to upgrade Optimism contracts and tune the economic parameters of the system, and (2) offchain social processes to maintain a healthy community.</p>\n<p><strong>Iteration</strong>. Optimism is decentralizing iteratively to increase the chances of building a healthy system that lasts for the long-term. This means the Foundation will play a role in establishing processes, help the Collective through its first few rapid feedback loops in improving those processes, then reduce its role over time. (This also means the design principles and goals outlined in this document may be invalidated or updated along the way.) This iteration gives the Collective a chance to learn how to make thoughtful decisions using an un-intuitive but essential loop: introduce a governance process that involves active participation, then gradually work to automate or minimize it over time. Governance\u2019s responsibility then becomes to adjust the autopilot when necessary, not to keep two hands on the wheel.</p>\n<p><strong>Forking</strong>. The right to fork and the right to exit are critical to protect individual freedoms. All of the core software and tooling required to run the Optimism network should be made open source, freely available, and easy to use such that a fork is always a viable alternative. This isn\u2019t just about vibes: in crypto, where credible commitments not to extract are <a href=\"https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/when-is-decentralizing-on-a-blockchain-valuable/\">what makes decentralized platforms valuable</a>, this is a competitive advantage. Participants will be more likely to join Optimism if they have the ability to make an alternative.</p>\n<p><strong>Balance</strong>. Influence in governance must extend beyond financial stake to value humanhood and intelligent life. The centralizing force of plutocratic token governance must be balanced with Citizenship. Giving voice and power to different constituents allows the Collective to match decisions with voters\u2019 incentives, rather than building a solely plutocratic system. Checks and balances prevent capture.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact = profit.</strong> A key part of the Optimistic Vision is to ensure that every individual is rewarded in proportion to their positive impact to the Collective. We believe this to be the most important target in the pursuit of solving global coordination problems and creating a better future. Our economy is an expression of our collective needs, wants, and ethics. Optimism Governance is ultimately responsible for enacting this fairness ratio that is key to the Optimistic Vision.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"design-overview-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#design-overview-4\"></a>Design Overview</h2>\n<p>The responsibilities of Optimism Governance can be categorized into one of the two primary goals of the governance system: <strong>Capture Resistance</strong> and <strong>Resource Allocation</strong>. Within each category, governance responsibilities are identified as (a) the exclusive responsibility of one or the other house, (b) a responsibility where one house drives proposals and the other house may veto, or (c) as a truly shared responsibility subject to approval by each house. This system is designed to help each house play to its strengths and avoid deadlock.</p>\n<p>The Optimism <strong>Token House</strong> is made up of OP tokenholders and their delegates. Tokenholders and their delegates are expected to be rational economic actors interested in preserving or increasing the economic well-being of the Optimism Collective. Therefore, the Token House is responsible for decisions that affect business parameters of the system such as inflation or the variables that govern sequencer selection. Token voting is distributed widely and permissionlessly and helps represent the free market in the Collective\u2019s decision making.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the Token House, the <strong>Citizens\u2019 House</strong> uses a one-person, one-vote system. Citizens are meant to represent individual human stakeholders of the Collective: builders, users, and community members who are aligned with the project\u2019s values and are interested in the long-term benefit of the Collective. Therefore, the Citizens\u2019 House is responsible for decisions that may require prioritizing long term growth ahead of other goals \u2013 decisions like allocating funding to public goods that support the Collective. In the long term, we can expect the Citizens\u2019 House to expand to include the thousands or millions or billions of humans interacting with Optimism.</p>\n<p>Governance responsibilities given to each house will change over time as the Collective iterates towards its long-term governance-minimized end state. This includes introducing highly manual governance responsibilities (e.g. inflation adjustments, or Superchain allowlists) that are intended to be replaced by automated smart defaults as the Collective learns how to govern these vectors appropriately. It may also include transitioning powers from the responsibility of the full governance body to a subset of governance participants who are empowered by their broader governance base.</p>\n<p>In these early chapters of Collective governance, many of these iterations have been designed or implemented by the Optimism Foundation. Eventually this must transition to the responsibility of Collective governance itself. This meta-governance power marks the end of the Foundation\u2019s stewardship of the evolution of Collective governance and entrusts the governance community with continued experimentation towards a healthy end-state for Optimism.</p>\n<p>So: what does governance\u2026 well, govern?</p>\n<h2><a name=\"problem-space-1-capture-resistance-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#problem-space-1-capture-resistance-5\"></a><strong>Problem Space <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1:</span> Capture Resistance</strong></h2>\n<p>Optimism Governance\u2019s first responsibility is to ensure that no single party can unilaterally control, censor, halt, or otherwise extract rent from Optimism. A decentralized compute layer is hardly valuable if controlled by a centralized entity. Governance helps the Collective make decisions in the absence of any one person or organization that is \u201cin charge.\u201d</p>\n<p>The responsibility to uphold capture resistance can be broken down into two broad categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>hard powers:</strong> governance powers that are eventually encoded and executed onchain, and</li>\n<li><strong>soft powers:</strong> social norms the governance community upholds, not enforced onchain but by the community\u2019s ability to fork.<br>\n<br></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>1/ Hard powers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Protocol Upgrades</strong> refer to the ability for governance to make changes to the OP Stack protocol itself. This is a crucial responsibility of governance that ultimately makes the community the steward of Optimism\u2019s core protocol functionality.</p>\n<p>Protocol upgrades will be approved by the Token House, subject to a Citizens\u2019 House veto. The Token House is the primary approver because of its broad reach and likelihood of representing business interests that depend on the OP Stack\u2019s functionality. The Citizens\u2019 House veto power guards against capture of the Token House and increases the resilience of the overall system.</p>\n<p>Today, protocol upgrades are approved by the Token House and executed manually by the Optimism Foundation. In the coming Seasons, the Collective may implement a Security Council responsible for executing upgrades following the will of governance. The Citizens\u2019 House veto power comes online in Season 5 (H1 2023), when the Citizens\u2019 House comes fully online. Eventually, execution of protocol upgrades will be fully onchain. On a far enough time horizon, we can expect protocol upgrades to become less and less common as the protocol nears feature completeness. We can look to protocols like Ethereum and Bitcoin as a model for what mature decentralized protocol upgrades look like.</p>\n<p><strong>Sequencer Selection</strong> is the ability to make choices about which parties may act as sequencers for OP Chains or in shared sequencing schemes.</p>\n<p>This begins as an explicit governance power driven by the Token House, with Citizens\u2019 House power to veto. Sequencers are important economic actors for OP Chains and eventually for the Superchain. The Token House is well-incentivized to make sure sequencer selection is fair and beneficial for the Collective. The Citizens\u2019 House veto power guards against the capture of the Token House related to sequencer selection.</p>\n<p>Today, OP Chains are sequenced by a handful of different entities. In Season 5, those sequencers will submit proposals to Optimism Governance to be formally included in the Superchain, officially bringing the hard power of sequencer selection into the hands of the Collective. More information about this governance process will be shared in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Eventually, sequencer selection may be fully automated based on verifiable and pre-agreed upon processes, enabling the sequencer set to be curated and maintained without active governance intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Citizenship Eligibility</strong> is the responsibility of governance to select new humans to participate in the Citizens\u2019 House of Optimism Governance.</p>\n<p>Citizenship Eligibility will be determined by the Citizens\u2019 House; the Token House will have the power to veto. Assuming good long-term values alignment with the Collective, Citizens should be incentivized to grow a set of voters that make quality decisions about RetroPGF allocations. A Token House veto guards against capture of the Citizens\u2019 House or moves to consolidate power.</p>\n<p>To date, Citizenship expansion has been administered by the Foundation. In the future, the Foundation will propose an expansion algorithm that Citizens vote to approve. Ultimately, Citizens may govern a citizenship selection algorithm directly that runs across identity data in the Optimism AttestationStation. In its final minimized form, the Citizens\u2019 House has established a battle-tested onchain selection process; updates to the contracts that govern selection can be made as necessary by the Citizens\u2019 House.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>2/ Soft powers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Code of Conduct Enforcement</strong> is the responsibility of governance to uphold and enforce the Optimism Collective Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>Each house may govern the code of conduct for its own members. The best cultural and values-based enforcement for governance communities should come from within that specific community.</p>\n<p>Today, CoC violations are processed with administration from the Foundation. In future Seasons, the community will iterate on this approach: Season 4 includes an <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2\">RFP for Code of Conduct research</a>, and Season 6 may introduce a new Council to replace the Foundation\u2019s role in this process. As a soft power, Code of Conduct enforcement will not be implemented onchain. For example, if a Token House delegate were to violate the Code of Conduct, that delegate would not be prevented from voting by an update to Optimism\u2019s voting contracts onchain. Rather, the community could enforce its rules and norms on the social layer by choosing to remove the participant from delegation frontends and UIs, or by informing the tokenholders who\u2019ve delegated to the offending party of the breach in conduct.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Removal</strong> is the right of governance to remove a director of the Optimism Foundation. Director Removals are approved by the Token House.</p>\n<p>This right is enforced and upheld by the Founding Documents of the Optimism Collective. As such, the Token House may vote to veto any reduction of this power. As Directors are not represented onchain, this responsibility does not have onchain enforceability.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"problem-space-2-resource-allocation-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#problem-space-2-resource-allocation-6\"></a><strong>Problem Space <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2:</span> Resource Allocation</strong></h2>\n<p>The second primary responsibility of Optimism governance is to allocate the Collective\u2019s resources to help it achieve its goals. This is a piece of essential governance that requires human intervention, especially in its early stages. Resource allocation in the Collective comes in three forms:</p>\n<p><strong>1/ Allocation of Protocol Revenue</strong><br>\n<strong>2/ OP Treasury Management</strong><br>\n<strong>3/ RetroPGF Funding</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Allocation of Protocol Revenue</strong> is the responsibility of governance to determine how to direct surplus ETH generated by the Optimism protocol. Optimism generates revenue through transaction fees paid on OP Mainnet and other OP Chains. Part of these transaction fees is used to post data to Ethereum L1 and pay for other expenses associated with running the protocol, and the remainder of the fee is accumulated as surplus revenue that can be directed by the Collective for the benefit of the Collective. In the future, the sequencing and proving networks that help run the Optimism protocol may also provide sources of revenue for the Collective.</p>\n<p>By default, surplus protocol revenue will be allocated to RetroPGF. The Token House may vote on proposals to divert a portion of the surplus protocol revenue for other Optimism Collective purposes as they see fit. These proposals will be subject to veto right by the Citizens\u2019 House.</p>\n<p>Protocol Revenue is a crucial lever in the Collective. In its early stages, the default allocation to RetroPGF lets the Collective reward projects that grow the Optimism ecosystem. As Optimism matures, the Token House is entrusted to propose deviations from this default for the health of the Optimism Collective. Citizens\u2019 House veto powers help hold the Token House accountable and prevent short term optimization at the expense of long term sustainability.</p>\n<p>In a future governance season, a proposal type will be introduced for proposing modifications to the allocation of surplus protocol revenue. These proposals may begin with certain safeguards, like a cap on possible allocations. Proposal power for high-level budgeting decisions may additionally be delegated to elected representatives as the Token House sees fit. The long term minimized state of this governance responsibility could include some thoughtful automation to determine revenue allocations based on indicators of whether the Collective should be in a \u201cgrowth\u201d stage or \u201cvalue\u201d stage.</p>\n<p><strong>OP Treasury Allocation</strong> is the responsibility of governance to direct how the existing OP token treasury is allocated. This has several components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <strong>Governance Fund</strong>, which is directed by Token House governance.</li>\n<li>The <strong>RetroPGF Fund</strong>, which is directed by Citizens\u2019 House governance, subject to a Token House veto.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Seed Fund</strong> and <strong>Unallocated</strong> portions of the token treasury, which are initially administered by the Foundation, and will eventually be directed jointly by both houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Foundation Budget Approvals</strong>, which are governed jointly by both houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Inflation adjustments</strong>, which are governed by the Token House, subject to a Citizens\u2019 House veto.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This distributed ownership of the OP Treasury allows for flexibility and gives each house a clear mechanism to allocate tokens for the development of the Collective. Today, treasury allocations are administered by the Foundation, and will gradually move onchain as the governance system matures and becomes more resilient. In the long term, as most of the Treasury is circulating, this power will boil down to the governance of inflation, which can be automated to a thoughtful set of defaults based on the economic health of the Collective.</p>\n<p><strong>RetroPGF Grants</strong> are the responsibility of governance to allocate RetroPGF to projects that have provided public good to the Optimism Collective. These grants may refer to either (a) OP tokens from the RetroPGF Fund portion of the token treasury (see OP Treasury Allocation), or (b) Profits generated by the Optimism Protocol that governance has decided to allocate to RetroPGF (see Allocation of Protocol Revenue). Specifically, this responsibility includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>RetroPGF Scope</strong>: the ability of governance to update the scope, metrics, and impact evaluation criteria used in determining how RetroPGF Grants are allocated to projects. In line with the principle of governance minimization, this should be a soft power.</li>\n<li><strong>Project Allocations</strong>: the ability of the Citizens\u2019 House to make specific individual project-level decisions about how the RetroPGF Scope is applied to allocate grants. This is the corresponding hard power for RetroPGF.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both components of RetroPGF Grants above are the responsibility of the Citizens\u2019 House. Citizens are selected as individual humans who are interested in the long term health of the Optimism Collective, and RetroPGF is a long term investment in Optimism\u2019s growth.</p>\n<p>Today, the Foundation identifies RetroPGF scope and Citizens make Project Allocation decisions. Eventually, Citizens will govern RetroPGF scope themselves.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Altogether, this looks like the diagram below:</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/caEzKbwfX1MMuFTjinRTEdM3vVD.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_690x345.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"caEzKbwfX1MMuFTjinRTEdM3vVD\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_690x345.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_1035x517.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_1380x690.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"23212B\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\"></span><span class=\"informations\">3840\u00d71921 572 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<h2><a name=\"additional-notes-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#additional-notes-7\"></a>Additional Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Incompleteness</strong></p>\n<p>The list above does not include all governance powers \u2013 it notably excludes governance responsibilities, especially social ones.</p>\n<p>The list above is also not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance powers will be rolled out and implemented. It is highly likely that the Collective will learn from initial experiments towards this blueprint and may make modifications to the processes outlined here. These \u201cProblem Spaces\u201d are intended as starting points for discussion, not as a prescriptive roadmap.</p>\n<p><strong>Checks, balances, and vetos</strong></p>\n<p>This post also excludes crucial design details about veto power, approval and quorum thresholds, proposal defaults, and failure modes. In particular, it\u2019s important to note that all veto powers are not created equal. A very high veto threshold and quorum create a higher bar for exercising veto power, where a simple majority could make for a relatively easy veto. These thresholds determine the balance of power in responsibilities shared between houses and must be considered carefully.</p>\n<p>The Collective will apply the principle of iteration in introducing these checks, balances, and vetos. This allows time to experiment with the right settings and make sure both branches of governance are developing safely.</p>\n<p>These details are incredibly important to the design of a well-functioning system, and members of the Collective are consulting with a set of experts, from crypto and beyond, to design a quality set of patterns to increase the chances of Optimism Governance\u2019s success. If you\u2019re interested in contributing to these efforts, you\u2019re welcome to reach out to <a href=\"http://mailto:bobby@optimism.io/\">bobby@optimism.io</a> or chime in on the governance forums.</p>\n<p><strong>Citizenship and capture</strong></p>\n<p>Since Citizens play a crucial role in the Optimism governance, it\u2019s paramount that the Citizens\u2019 House is qualified and capture-resistant. Several factors come into play here, including the ways identity and contribution history can help inform citizenship eligibility; public and private voting strategies to help prevent collusion and bribery; citizenship incentives; escape hatches and metagovernance in the event of capture; and the iterative path towards growing the set of Citizens and their responsibilities. These important topics will be discussed in greater detail in a future post.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-milestones-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#key-milestones-8\"></a>Key Milestones</h1>\n<p>Optimism Governance continues to make steady strides towards a robust and sustainable system. Here are some of the next milestones for the Collective in the coming quarters:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"season-5-2024-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#season-5-2024-9\"></a><strong>Season 5 [2024]</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sequencer Allowlist / Law of Chains</strong><br>\nSeason 5 will introduce the governance system\u2019s power to welcome new Sequencers into the Superchain. More information about sequencer governance (and its relation to chain, user, and platform governance) will be shared in the coming weeks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Joint-House voting</strong><br>\nIn Season 5, the Collective will bring the Citizens\u2019 House fully online and execute its first set of joint-house votes. After executing three rounds of RetroPGF, this milestone will mark the next stage of maturity for the Citizens\u2019 House as they participate in Optimism Governance beyond RetroPGF grant allocations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Security Council v1</strong><br>\nSeason 5 will also include the Optimism Security Council. The Security Council is a set of community members tasked with executing protocol upgrades at the will of governance. This replaces the multisig wallet controlled by the Optimism Foundation and marks an important milestone in protocol decentralization.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"season-6-2024-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#season-6-2024-10\"></a><strong>Season 6 [2024]</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Protocol Revenue Allocation</strong><br>\nSeason 6 will introduce the initial process for votes to allocate Protocol Revenue. It\u2019s possible this process will include the introduction of a Treasury Council responsible for making high-level proposals to governance about how to allocate resources; any proposal for protocol revenue allocation will be submitted to the Token House for approval, and to the Citizens\u2019 House for veto.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Onchain treasury execution</strong><br>\nIn Season 6, parts of the Optimism Treasury will move onchain. This means governance will be able to initiate transactions that move tokens from the OP Token Treasury entirely onchain. As noted above, this onchain execution will begin with an emergency safeguard that will be removed in future seasons.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>"}}

This implies that Ethereum proposers could incorporate rollup blocks within their Layer 1 blocks.

In this context, there\u2019s no obligation to commit a significant amount of capital to be an operator in the system. Rather, it\u2019s the rollup governance that elects the sequencers. This seems to be the direction that the Optimism collective is veering towards, and I intend to elaborate further on this choice.<br>\nSpecifically, for Optimism, defined governance mechanisms are apparent, such as the selection of delegates from the token house and their capacity to advocate for upgrades. It\u2019s important to bear in mind that members of the citizen house retain the right to veto. I presume that the sequencer election process will be governed by the Optimism collective\u2019s governance, prompting an exploration of the potential tradeoffs:</p>\n<p>The first pertains to <strong>permissionlessness.</strong> The need to be elected by the governance reduces the permissionless aspect of the protocol. But it raises the question: does Optimism need to have the same number of operators as Ethereum currently does (which is somewhat related to Proof of Stake)? Ethereum needs to be an entirely credibly neutral system, justifying permissionless access for joining or expanding the validator set. In my personal opinion, Optimism doesn\u2019t have this obligation, it already inherits the security and decentralization of the base layer. It compensates Ethereum specifically for this purpose by paying for it which means that the tradeoffs are not the same and it is not necessarily needed to \u201ccopy\u201d Ethereum. Moreover, the act of controlling access to the sequencer set could empower the Optimism governance to enforce certain behaviours that can\u2019t be programmed client-side, such as particular types of transaction ordering, thereby eventually preventing sandwich attacks. It\u2019s worth noting that initiatives like Flashbot\u2019s Suave Chain, which could function as a block builder for different rollups, could eventually remedy this, although it\u2019s not quite there yet.</p>\n<p>The second consideration revolves around <strong>commitment</strong>. Unlike Proof of Stake, there wouldn\u2019t be an opportunity to slash sequencers for any malevolent behaviours. However, it would be possible to get rid of them via a governance upgrade. Is this problematic? I\u2019m not entirely sure, provided that the negative incentives are transparent and universally understood (e.g forfeiting all future revenue). It\u2019s important to highlight that sequencers have a shorter timeframe and less power than Ethereum validators to execute a reorg. Once they submit data to Ethereum, there\u2019s no avenue for them to reorg. Ethereum would have to revert to reorg the blocks, so sequencers can only revert on pre-confirmations prior to the data root being posted to the base layer.</p>\n<p>The third aspect relates to <strong>tokenomics</strong>. A notable advantage is that capital doesn\u2019t need to be locked at all, there\u2019s no need to issue a liquid staking token. The token can remain in its native form. The value capture mechanism will likely be up to the governance (e.g allocating a portion to the treasury, retro pgf, burn). Furthermore, the payment to the sequencers could also be subject to the governance process.<br>\nUltimately, the leader election mechanism that we obtain is a separation of capital and labor because that\u2019s where the economic incentives lie, alongside a governance mechanism aligned with Optimism that manages the delegate selection and, consequently, the operator selection.<br>\nIn reality, it doesn\u2019t make much sense to give up a) value and b) the governance process on the operator side to another liquid staking protocol, specially when there\u2019s an opinionated and active governance in place, which I believe is the case for the Optimism collective.</p>\n<p><strong>Suggestions</strong></p>\n<p>The delegation process in a Proof of Stake (DPoS) network is worth comparing to a governance-based network. What I mean is, when you delegate your funds in a governance-based structure, your personal funds aren\u2019t at risk, so you avoid the potential risk of seeing users delegating their funds only to the \u201ctop\u201d validators of the protocol. Ultimately, the delegation process is dependent on the governance that votes for the collective interest which is very different, an example of it would be electing a set of sequencers based on distributed geographical position. In my humble opinion, this would be challenging to corrupt.</p>\n<p>It might also be beneficial to introduce a mechanism for the rotation of sequencers (e.g in a round-robin style) to ensure that each sequencer elected by the governance has an equal opportunity to order transactions and propose a block. Additionally, incentivizing honest behaviour by requiring sequencers to post a bond when they are elected could be interesting.</p>\n<p>It would also be worth exploring the implementation of backup mechanisms in the event of a liveness failure (if the elected sequencer goes offline and a certain number of blocks are missed, other sequencers also previously elected by the governance could step in, even if it wasn\u2019t initially their turn).<br>\nFurthermore, a reputational mechanism could potentially be beneficial to minimize the risk of this scenario recurring.</p>\n<p>Concerning censorship resistance, forcing transactions directly through Ethereum Layer 1 doesn\u2019t seem to be the endgame since it might be excessively costly for certain users. Therefore, having a sufficiently diversified sequencer set can help prevent this necessity. In the grand scheme of things, resorting to Ethereum guarantees around censorship resistance or even liveness will generally be slower since Layer 2 block times are typically faster than Layer 1 block times.

This Season, the Collective aligned around Collective Intents and increased the number of non-core teams building the Collective with the introduction of Missions. The Grants Council, renewed for a second Season, processed an incredible 448 grant applications! Votable supply of OP increased from 40M to 69M and it was the first full Season voting on <a href=\"https://vote.optimism.io/\">Agora</a>! The Citizens\u2019 House expanded to ~138 badgeholders and will reward 30M OP in <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Upn_LtV2-3SviXgX_PE_LyA7YI00jQyoM1yf55ltvvI\">RetroPGF Round 3</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"why-retroactive-rewards-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#why-retroactive-rewards-3\"></a>Why Retroactive Rewards?</h3>\n<p>The Optimism Collective rewards delegates retroactively. Retroactive rewards are a core pillar of the large scale experiment to establish a new, regenerative economic system within the Collective. <strong>Retroactive rewards will be the primary contribution reward mechanism in the Collective</strong> and when the Governance Fund runs out of OP (as it is intended to), RetroPGF will need to support all activity in the Collective.</p>\n<p>Feedback on retro delegate rewards is extremely helpful in refining what will be the primary reward mechanism in the Collective. Delegates have requested more insight into the actions that are likely to be considered high impact in the upcoming Season, similarly to how RetroPGF Scope and Collective Intents are defined.  There have also been several discussions about setting expectations for high impact delegate/badgeholders. Please see the <strong><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889\">Anticapture Commission</a></strong>, a first step towards defining the highest impact delegates and empowering them with additional resources.</p>\n<p>Other reasons for maintaining retroactive delegate rewards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The amount of participation required will continue to vary dramatically as governance experiments evolve Season over Season. Retroactive rewards are better able to adapt to this level of iteration.</li>\n<li>Rewards that are allocated retroactively are not subject to a lock-up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you to your continued dedication to this experiment to retroactively reward impact. Being a delegate requires a serious time commitment and the Collective strongly benefits from your engagement.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The below criteria recognizes top delegates in Season 4 (snapshot as of 9/7/23, the start of the last Voting Cycle of the Season, in which there were no votes.)</p>\n<p>Delegates that meet the below criteria are eligible to receive a rewards as outlined in the below chart.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top 100 delegates by voting power (this has been adjusted from delegates with &gt;0.25%, based on delegate feedback.)\n<ul>\n<li>Protocols in the Protocol Delegation Program that qualified as top 100 delegates only as a result of Foundation delegations are not eligible for rewards.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Criteria</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n<th>Reasoning</th>\n<th>OP</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Participated in Season 4</td>\n<td>&gt;70% voting participation in Season 4 (abstain votes count towards participation).

In Season 3, the Foundation provided retroactive rewards to the Grants Council for their outsized impact as the Foundation proposed the Council\u2019s initial budget. Since the Council now proposes its own budget, and Token House Seasons are now aligned with RetroPGF rounds, it is important that the Council\u2019s impact be assessed by the Collective and rewarded via RetroPGF. The Grants Council is encouraged to apply as a project in Round 3, so that the Collective may reward the impact the Grants Council created in Season 4.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"qualifying-delegates-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#qualifying-delegates-4\"></a>Qualifying delegates</h2>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Top 100 Delegates (All reward amounts in OP)</th>\n<th>&gt; 70% Voting Participation (Baseline rewards)</th>\n<th>Reflection Period Participation</th>\n<th>Supported Missions</th>\n<th>Total</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Linda Xie</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polynya</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Synthetix ambassadors</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>L2BEAT</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jack Anorak</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GFX Labs</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lefteris Karapetsas</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PoolCollective</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Michael Vander Meiden</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>9,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>404 DAO</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Boiler Blockchain</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>9,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Olimpio</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blockchain@USC</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PGov</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Katie</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Griff Green</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Velodrome</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>9,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Paraswap</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Pika</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Rubicon</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Polynomial</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>9,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Galxe</td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Clique</td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Lyra</td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Kyberswap</td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Gelato</td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Joxes -

This Season, the Collective aligned around Collective Intents and increased the number of non-core teams building the Collective with the introduction of Missions. The Grants Council, renewed for a second Season, processed an incredible 448 grant applications! Votable supply of OP increased from 40M to 69M and it was the first full Season voting on <a href=\"https://vote.optimism.io/\">Agora</a>! The Citizens\u2019 House expanded to ~138 badgeholders and will reward 30M OP in <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Upn_LtV2-3SviXgX_PE_LyA7YI00jQyoM1yf55ltvvI\">RetroPGF Round 3</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"why-retroactive-rewards-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#why-retroactive-rewards-3\"></a>Why Retroactive Rewards?</h3>\n<p>The Optimism Collective rewards delegates retroactively. Retroactive rewards are a core pillar of the large scale experiment to establish a new, regenerative economic system within the Collective. <strong>Retroactive rewards will be the primary contribution reward mechanism in the Collective</strong> and when the Governance Fund runs out of OP (as it is intended to), RetroPGF will need to support all activity in the Collective.</p>\n<p>Feedback on retro delegate rewards is extremely helpful in refining what will be the primary reward mechanism in the Collective. Delegates have requested more insight into the actions that are likely to be considered high impact in the upcoming Season, similarly to how RetroPGF Scope and Collective Intents are defined.  There have also been several discussions about setting expectations for high impact delegate/badgeholders. Please see the <strong><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889\">Anticapture Commission</a></strong>, a first step towards defining the highest impact delegates and empowering them with additional resources.</p>\n<p>Other reasons for maintaining retroactive delegate rewards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The amount of participation required will continue to vary dramatically as governance experiments evolve Season over Season. Retroactive rewards are better able to adapt to this level of iteration.</li>\n<li>Rewards that are allocated retroactively are not subject to a lock-up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you to your continued dedication to this experiment to retroactively reward impact. Being a delegate requires a serious time commitment and the Collective strongly benefits from your engagement.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The below criteria recognizes top delegates in Season 4 (snapshot as of 9/7/23, the start of the last Voting Cycle of the Season, in which there were no votes.)</p>\n<p>Delegates that meet the below criteria are eligible to receive a rewards as outlined in the below chart.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top 100 delegates by voting power (this has been adjusted from delegates with &gt;0.25%, based on delegate feedback.)\n<ul>\n<li>Protocols in the Protocol Delegation Program that qualified as top 100 delegates only as a result of Foundation delegations are not eligible for rewards.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Criteria</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n<th>Reasoning</th>\n<th>OP</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Participated in Season 4</td>\n<td>&gt;70% voting participation in Season 4 (abstain votes count towards participation).

In Season 3, the Foundation provided retroactive rewards to the Grants Council for their outsized impact as the Foundation proposed the Council\u2019s initial budget. Since the Council now proposes its own budget, and Token House Seasons are now aligned with RetroPGF rounds, it is important that the Council\u2019s impact be assessed by the Collective and rewarded via RetroPGF. The Grants Council is encouraged to apply as a project in Round 3, so that the Collective may reward the impact the Grants Council created in Season 4.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"qualifying-delegates-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#qualifying-delegates-4\"></a>Qualifying delegates</h2>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Top 100 Delegates (All reward amounts in OP)</th>\n<th>&gt; 70% Voting Participation (Baseline rewards)</th>\n<th>Reflection Period Participation</th>\n<th>Supported Missions</th>\n<th>Total</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Linda Xie</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polynya</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Synthetix ambassadors</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>L2BEAT</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jack Anorak</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GFX Labs</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lefteris Karapetsas</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PoolCollective</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Michael Vander Meiden</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>9,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>404 DAO</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Boiler Blockchain</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>9,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Olimpio</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blockchain@USC</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PGov</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Katie</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Griff Green</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Velodrome</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>9,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Paraswap</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Pika</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Rubicon</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Polynomial</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>9,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Galxe</td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Clique</td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Lyra</td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Kyberswap</td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Gelato</td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Ineligible</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Joxes -

My team, behind the <a href=\"https://optimism.curiahub.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OP governance analytics dashboard</a> - has been closely monitoring governance activities and voting participation. Our data indicates that MinimalGravitas was active in 3 out of the 4 (75%) proposal during Season 4 (starting June 8th) and since we went onchain voting, MinimalGravitas voted on 14 out of the 15 proposals (that\u2019s 93.3%). When we look at the requirement for the Top 100 delegates on the snapshot date, MinimalGravitas secured the 62nd rank for delegate by voting power. Both of these facts clearly meet the &gt;70% voting participation criteria for the rewards.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d67fc48093fb51a79f3ea5a5f2f17b388dd687d3.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uBxV0r7Hcc7U3nanGCqHQ1hV7cD.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d67fc48093fb51a79f3ea5a5f2f17b388dd687d3_2_513x500.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"uBxV0r7Hcc7U3nanGCqHQ1hV7cD\" width=\"513\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d67fc48093fb51a79f3ea5a5f2f17b388dd687d3_2_513x500.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d67fc48093fb51a79f3ea5a5f2f17b388dd687d3_2_769x750.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d67fc48093fb51a79f3ea5a5f2f17b388dd687d3_2_1026x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F6F6\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1472\u00d71432 354 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bbc526c886552aca4dd8fe9a1787e9229ea9594c.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qN5Gi1CLTYclR5YWVYzRTyaKlZ2.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bbc526c886552aca4dd8fe9a1787e9229ea9594c_2_690x435.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"qN5Gi1CLTYclR5YWVYzRTyaKlZ2\" width=\"690\" height=\"435\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bbc526c886552aca4dd8fe9a1787e9229ea9594c_2_690x435.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bbc526c886552aca4dd8fe9a1787e9229ea9594c_2_1035x652.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bbc526c886552aca4dd8fe9a1787e9229ea9594c.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D2D2CC\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1068\u00d7674 101 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>A detailed view of the MinimalGravitas proposals participation can be accessed here: <a href=\"https://optimism.curiahub.xyz/delegates/0x7899d9b1181cbb427b0b1be0684c096c260f7474\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MinimalGravitas Delegate</a></p>\n<p>Our aim is to contribute to greater transparency for initiatives like these.

My team, behind the <a href=\"https://optimism.curiahub.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OP governance analytics dashboard</a> - has been closely monitoring governance activities and voting participation. Our data indicates that MinimalGravitas was active in 3 out of the 4 (75%) proposal during Season 4 (starting June 8th) and since we went onchain voting, MinimalGravitas voted on 14 out of the 15 proposals (that\u2019s 93.3%). When we look at the requirement for the Top 100 delegates on the snapshot date, MinimalGravitas secured the 62nd rank for delegate by voting power. Both of these facts clearly meet the &gt;70% voting participation criteria for the rewards.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/d67fc48093fb51a79f3ea5a5f2f17b388dd687d3.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uBxV0r7Hcc7U3nanGCqHQ1hV7cD.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d67fc48093fb51a79f3ea5a5f2f17b388dd687d3_2_513x500.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"uBxV0r7Hcc7U3nanGCqHQ1hV7cD\" width=\"513\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d67fc48093fb51a79f3ea5a5f2f17b388dd687d3_2_513x500.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d67fc48093fb51a79f3ea5a5f2f17b388dd687d3_2_769x750.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/d67fc48093fb51a79f3ea5a5f2f17b388dd687d3_2_1026x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F6F6\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1472\u00d71432 354 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bbc526c886552aca4dd8fe9a1787e9229ea9594c.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qN5Gi1CLTYclR5YWVYzRTyaKlZ2.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bbc526c886552aca4dd8fe9a1787e9229ea9594c_2_690x435.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"qN5Gi1CLTYclR5YWVYzRTyaKlZ2\" width=\"690\" height=\"435\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bbc526c886552aca4dd8fe9a1787e9229ea9594c_2_690x435.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/bbc526c886552aca4dd8fe9a1787e9229ea9594c_2_1035x652.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/bbc526c886552aca4dd8fe9a1787e9229ea9594c.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D2D2CC\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1068\u00d7674 101 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>A detailed view of the MinimalGravitas proposals participation can be accessed here: <a href=\"https://optimism.curiahub.xyz/delegates/0x7899d9b1181cbb427b0b1be0684c096c260f7474\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MinimalGravitas Delegate</a></p>\n<p>Our aim is to contribute to greater transparency for initiatives like these.

This Charter will be updated with exact participant numbers and signing thresholds according to the change process outlined below before the Security Council is implemented.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"security-council-charter-v01-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#security-council-charter-v01-1\"></a><strong>Security Council Charter v0.1</strong></h1>\n<h2><a name=\"goals-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#goals-2\"></a><strong>Goals</strong></h2>\n<p>In short, the goal of the Security Council is to turn admin keys for OP Mainnet, and eventually, all OP Chains in the Superchain, over to a public, decentralized set of individual actors (\u201cparticipants\u201d) accountable to Optimism Governance. Executed correctly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No single party should be able to upgrade the system, modify rollup state, or censor transactions.</li>\n<li>Each participant custodies and uses their key securely.</li>\n<li>During normal operations, the Council simply implements the upgrade and role permission decisions made by Governance, rather than making decisions itself.</li>\n<li>During defined emergency situations, the Security Council is empowered to act without direct Governance approval to keep the network safe and secure.</li>\n<li>Dysfunctional participants, either individually or acting as a quorum, can be effectively checked, without undermining the security advantages motivating the formation of the Council in the first place.</li>\n<li>Finally, a successful Security Council is one whose role is progressively and programmatically reduced over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"structure-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#structure-3\"></a><strong>Structure</strong></h2>\n<p>The structure of the Security Council is designed to satisfy the multisig requirements of Stage 1 decentralization while, wherever practicable, prioritizing safety over liveness. Security Council participants will be expected to carry out their responsibilities consistent with this Charter and the provisions of the Law of Chains.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"council-composition-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#council-composition-4\"></a><strong>Council Composition</strong></h3>\n<p>The Security Council will operate a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet. The multisig will have a 75% threshold. Each participant will control one key, with the exception of the Council Lead (who is not a key holder).</p>\n<p>The Council Lead will coordinate the ongoing operations of the key holding Council participants. The Council Lead\u2019s role is procedural, communicative, and ministerial. It has no ability to influence the substantive signing decisions of key holders.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"normal-operation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#normal-operation-5\"></a><strong>Normal Operation</strong></h3>\n<p>During normal operation, the Security Council is intended to act as an oracle for the Optimism Governance process: initiating protocol upgrades and changing role designations (such as designations for the Sequencer, Proposer, and Challenger roles, as well as designating the composition of the participants on the Security Council multisig), solely as directed by Optimism Collective governance outcomes.</p>\n<p>Council participants are expected to verify that a proposed protocol upgrade or role designation decision has been approved by Optimism Governance. They are not expected to directly evaluate the \u201cmerit\u201d of the accompanying proposed code (e.g., for security purposes).</p>\n<p>In typical cases, signing should be scheduled in advance and in accordance with the Collective\u2019s governance calendar.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"emergency-response-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#emergency-response-6\"></a><strong>Emergency Response</strong></h3>\n<p>The Security Council is permitted to preemptively address actual or anticipated bugs, defects, unplanned maintenance, or stability, integrity, availability, non-repudiation or other security issues with the OP Stack or any OP Chain.</p>\n<p>To protect Security Council members, each participant may also take actions they or the Optimism Foundation believes to be necessary to comply with applicable law.</p>\n<p>These emergency response measures may be taken without specific Governance approval.</p>\n<p>If the Security Council ever utilizes this discretion, however, it should endeavor to provide the community with a prompt and comprehensive retrospective (within the bounds of any legal commitments to, or security requirements for, confidentiality) on the action taken and the rationale for it.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"multisig-actions-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#multisig-actions-7\"></a><strong>Multisig Actions</strong></h3>\n<p>The Security Council multisig is responsible for two types of action:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Protocol upgrades:</strong> Upgrades to the L1 protocol contracts of an OP Chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Designation changes:</strong> The designation of the onchain addresses that are authorized to perform the following roles on OP Chains: sequencers (i.e., batchers), proposers, challengers, and membership on the Security Council multisig. All protocol upgrades, and designation changes for removing a sequencer from the sequencer allowlist, are subject to a delayed upgrade mechanism (see below). All other permission changes are not.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"delayed-upgrades-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#delayed-upgrades-8\"></a><strong>Delayed Upgrades</strong></h3>\n<p>All protocol upgrades, and the specific designation change that removes a sequencer for the sequencer allowlist, are subject to a 14 day delay period before becoming effective. This delay period applies regardless of whether the corresponding multisig action is first approved by Optimism Governance or implemented preemptively by the Security Council as an emergency response.</p>\n<p>During that 14 day period, the Optimism Foundation may veto the upgrade. The Foundation will endeavor to use this veto authority consistent with the \u201cEmergency Response\u201d parameters outlined above and the provisions of the Law of Chains. As with the existence of the Security Council in general, the Foundation\u2019s role in vetoing upgrades should be reduced over time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"challenging-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#challenging-9\"></a><strong>Challenging</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to implementing protocol upgrades and role permissioning, the Security Council will initially be authorized to perform the Challenger role (on a 1-of-3 basis) for each OP Chain, along with each OP Chain\u2019s Governor, and Foundation.</p>\n<p>In this role, the Council will be responsible for challenging faulty output proposals within the applicable challenge period (currently 7 days) in the event that all other Challengers fail to challenge.</p>\n<p>A faulty output proposal is a commitment to an L2 state root by an OP Chain\u2019s proposer that can be independently verified as faulty by an OP Stack node which observes L1 and derives the L2 state from it.</p>\n<p>It is expected that various members of the Optimism Collective would call attention to a faulty L2 output proposal. The Security Council participants would then:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Run scripts to independently verify that the output is faulty; and</li>\n<li>Submit and approve a call to delete this output.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The OP Stack includes infrastructure for identifying a faulty output. Security Council participants will not be required to run this infrastructure (although it is encouraged).</p>\n<p>The Council\u2019s responsibility to perform a Challenger role is intended to be reduced as multi-client fault proofs are rolled out.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"participants-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#participants-10\"></a><strong>Participants</strong></h2>\n<p>This section describes the expectations for Security Council participants, including both key holders and the Council Lead.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"cohorts-and-election-terms-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#cohorts-and-election-terms-11\"></a><strong>Cohorts and Election Terms</strong></h3>\n<p>Security Council participants will serve in two cohorts, subject to recurring, staggered re-election periods. The initial Cohort 1 (at least 50% of the total number of participants) will serve for 12 months. The initial Cohort 2 (the remaining participants) will serve for 18 months. These initial cohorts of Security Council participants will be proposed by the Optimism Foundation, subject to ratification by the Token House.</p>\n<p>Six months prior to the expiration of the cohorts\u2019 respective terms, there will be elections to replace or renew the signers in that cohort. All subsequently elected cohorts will serve a 12 month term. Elections are expected to follow the standard election format used for all Councils in the Collective.</p>\n<p>Participants are subject to eligibility screening prior to joining the Council and receiving signing authorization on the multisig (see \u201cParticipants \u2013 Eligibility,\u201d below). There is no limit to the number of terms a Security Council participant may serve.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"eligibility-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#eligibility-12\"></a><strong>Eligibility</strong></h3>\n<p>Participants on the Security Council should be selected in accordance with the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Technical competency.</strong> Baseline proficiency with the OP Stack and secure key management and signing standards.</li>\n<li><strong>Reputation.</strong> Known, trusted individuals or entities that have demonstrated consistent alignment with the Optimistic Vision.</li>\n<li><strong>Geographic diversity.</strong> The number of participants that reside in any country should be less than the quorum required for multisig action. To avoid requiring participants to publicly disclose their physical locations, this requirement will be enforced by the Optimism Foundation as part of the eligibility screening process.</li>\n<li><strong>Diversity of interests.</strong> No more than 1 participant is associated with a particular entity, or that entity\u2019s employees or affiliates.</li>\n<li><strong>Alignment.</strong> Participants should not possess conflicts of interest that will regularly impact their ability to make impartial decisions in the performance of their role.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, all participants will be required to pass an eligibility screening process before being added to the Council. This process may include KYC/AML and sanctions screening and a requirement that the member sign a standard contract, which will be implemented at the discretion of the Optimism Foundation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"responsibilities-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#responsibilities-13\"></a><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h3>\n<p>Security Council key holding participants will be responsible for developing and complying with procedures to facilitate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communication and coordination among the participants;</li>\n<li>Secure key management;</li>\n<li>Verifying and promptly enacting Optimism Governance-approved upgrades and permission changes;</li>\n<li>Notifying the other participants of, and collaborating in good faith to promptly resolve, defined emergency situations (see \u201cEmergency Response,\u201d above); and</li>\n<li>Proving continued access to keys via periodic liveness checks, where participants must prove they can access their keys within a set time limit. For security purposes, the details of these procedures should remain private among the Council.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Council Lead, meanwhile, is responsible for supporting the implementation and operationalization of the aforementioned procedures, including by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alerting key holders of upcoming protocol upgrade or role permissioning proposals going through Governance;</li>\n<li>Managing required timelines;</li>\n<li>Scheduling, setting agendas, and hosting Council meetings and facilitating discussions;</li>\n<li>Monitoring compliance with the procedures;</li>\n<li>Onboarding new Council participants; and</li>\n<li>Communicating with external stakeholders, including Optimism Governance, as to Council operations. All Security Council participants are expected to perform these responsibilities with the awareness that OP Chains, the OP Stack, the developing Superchain, and the associated products, tools, and documentation are in a rapidly evolving nascent state. To the extent that unforeseeable circumstances or ambiguities arise (including in connection with potential responses to Exception Events), the participants will work in good faith to resolve them consistent with this Charter and the Law of Chains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, all Security Council participants are also responsible for complying with (i) the Code of Conduct of the Optimism Collective and (ii) any additional, internal conflict of interest procedures that the Council may develop from time to time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"accountability-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#accountability-14\"></a><strong>Accountability</strong></h3>\n<p>The Security Council is accountable to Optimism Governance. The Token House may vote to remove Security Council members at any time for severe violations of the Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>The Security Council can also act unilaterally to remove a participant who fails to satisfy the requirements of this Charter if such failure falls within the defined scope of the Council\u2019s emergency powers (see \u201cStructure \u2013 Emergency Response\u201d above).</p>\n<p>Governance votes for removal of a Security Council participant for violation of the Code of Conduct will occur before the end of the next voting cycle (a delay of 3 weeks maximum). A contingent vote for their replacement on the Council will run in the same voting cycle.</p>\n<p>Security Council members may be removed for failure to satisfy the requirements of this Charter immediately via an Emergency Response. A vote for their replacement on the Council would run in the next nearest voting cycle.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if a Security Council key holder fails to prove access to their keys by satisfying the requirements of a scheduled liveness check (see \u201cParticipants \u2013 Responsibilities,\u201d above), that participant will be automatically removed from the Council. A vote for their replacement on the Council would run in the next nearest voting cycle.</p>\n<p>Any time a key holder is removed from the Council, the threshold may also be reduced to as long as the ratio of the threshold to the number of signers remains above 75%. If the number of signers is reduced below 8, then a safety mechanism is activated which hands control of the Security Council to the Foundation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"budget-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#budget-15\"></a><strong>Budget</strong></h3>\n<p>Initially, the Optimism Foundation will cover member expenses and may provide members with a stipend. The Security Council will not request a budget from the Governance Fund at this time.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"iteration-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#iteration-16\"></a><strong>Iteration</strong></h2>\n<p>The canonical version of the Charter will be published to GitHub. Any material updates to the Charter will be reflected with a new version number at the top of this document, at which point the updated version will go into effect.</p>\n<p>For clarity, however, this Charter cannot be altered in any way that would have the effect of fundamentally altering the security model of an OP Chain or constitute a de facto protocol upgrade (both of which require an Optimism Governance vote).</p>\n<p>It should finally be reiterated that the role of the Security Council is intended to be progressively and programmatically reduced over time, as its functionalities are no longer needed or can be effectively managed directly by Governance. Ultimately, it is the goal of the Collective and this Council that we reach a state of protocol and governance reliability that allows for the full deprecation of the Council\u2019s multisig, and the full and final dissolution of the Council.</p>", "post_number": 1, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2023-10-23T03:53:16.765Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 41, "reads": 30, "readers_count": 29, "score": 240.8, "yours": false, "topic_id": 6884, "topic_slug": "security-council-charter-v0-1", "display_username": "system", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "flair_group_id": null, "version": 3, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "link_counts": [{"url": "https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Security%20Council%20Charter%20v0.1.md", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "clicks": 5}, {"url": "https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-vote-1-change-to-security-model/6886/16", "internal": true, "reflection": true, "title": "Security Council: Vote #1 - Change to Security Model", "clicks": 3}, {"url": "https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-vote-1-change-to-security-model/6886/21", "internal": true, "reflection": true, "title": "Security Council: Vote #1 - Change to Security Model", "clicks": 0}], "read": true, "user_title": null, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 2}], "moderator": true, "admin": true, "staff": true, "user_id": -1, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 4, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": false, "can_vote": false}, "subpath": ["29931"], "author": "system", "creation_time": "2023-09-28T20:01:10.527000+00:00", "content": "<p>This document describes the current Security Council Charter.

As with the existence of the Security Council in general, the Foundation\u2019s role in vetoing upgrades should be reduced over time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"challenging-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#challenging-9\"></a><strong>Challenging</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to implementing protocol upgrades and role permissioning, the Security Council will initially be authorized to perform the Challenger role (on a 1-of-3 basis) for each OP Chain, along with each OP Chain\u2019s Governor, and Foundation.</p>\n<p>In this role, the Council will be responsible for challenging faulty output proposals within the applicable challenge period (currently 7 days) in the event that all other Challengers fail to challenge.</p>\n<p>A faulty output proposal is a commitment to an L2 state root by an OP Chain\u2019s proposer that can be independently verified as faulty by an OP Stack node which observes L1 and derives the L2 state from it.</p>\n<p>It is expected that various members of the Optimism Collective would call attention to a faulty L2 output proposal. The Security Council participants would then:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Run scripts to independently verify that the output is faulty; and</li>\n<li>Submit and approve a call to delete this output.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The OP Stack includes infrastructure for identifying a faulty output. Security Council participants will not be required to run this infrastructure (although it is encouraged).</p>\n<p>The Council\u2019s responsibility to perform a Challenger role is intended to be reduced as multi-client fault proofs are rolled out.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"participants-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#participants-10\"></a><strong>Participants</strong></h2>\n<p>This section describes the expectations for Security Council participants, including both key holders and the Council Lead.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"cohorts-and-election-terms-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#cohorts-and-election-terms-11\"></a><strong>Cohorts and Election Terms</strong></h3>\n<p>Security Council participants will serve in two cohorts, subject to recurring, staggered re-election periods. The initial Cohort 1 (at least 50% of the total number of participants) will serve for 12 months. The initial Cohort 2 (the remaining participants) will serve for 18 months. These initial cohorts of Security Council participants will be proposed by the Optimism Foundation, subject to ratification by the Token House.</p>\n<p>Six months prior to the expiration of the cohorts\u2019 respective terms, there will be elections to replace or renew the signers in that cohort. All subsequently elected cohorts will serve a 12 month term. Elections are expected to follow the standard election format used for all Councils in the Collective.</p>\n<p>Participants are subject to eligibility screening prior to joining the Council and receiving signing authorization on the multisig (see \u201cParticipants \u2013 Eligibility,\u201d below). There is no limit to the number of terms a Security Council participant may serve.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"eligibility-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#eligibility-12\"></a><strong>Eligibility</strong></h3>\n<p>Participants on the Security Council should be selected in accordance with the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Technical competency.</strong> Baseline proficiency with the OP Stack and secure key management and signing standards.</li>\n<li><strong>Reputation.</strong> Known, trusted individuals or entities that have demonstrated consistent alignment with the Optimistic Vision.</li>\n<li><strong>Geographic diversity.</strong> The number of participants that reside in any country should be less than the quorum required for multisig action. To avoid requiring participants to publicly disclose their physical locations, this requirement will be enforced by the Optimism Foundation as part of the eligibility screening process.</li>\n<li><strong>Diversity of interests.</strong> No more than 1 participant is associated with a particular entity, or that entity\u2019s employees or affiliates.</li>\n<li><strong>Alignment.</strong> Participants should not possess conflicts of interest that will regularly impact their ability to make impartial decisions in the performance of their role.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, all participants will be required to pass an eligibility screening process before being added to the Council. This process may include KYC/AML and sanctions screening and a requirement that the member sign a standard contract, which will be implemented at the discretion of the Optimism Foundation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"responsibilities-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#responsibilities-13\"></a><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h3>\n<p>Security Council key holding participants will be responsible for developing and complying with procedures to facilitate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communication and coordination among the participants;</li>\n<li>Secure key management;</li>\n<li>Verifying and promptly enacting Optimism Governance-approved upgrades and permission changes;</li>\n<li>Notifying the other participants of, and collaborating in good faith to promptly resolve, defined emergency situations (see \u201cEmergency Response,\u201d above); and</li>\n<li>Proving continued access to keys via periodic liveness checks, where participants must prove they can access their keys within a set time limit. For security purposes, the details of these procedures should remain private among the Council.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Council Lead, meanwhile, is responsible for supporting the implementation and operationalization of the aforementioned procedures, including by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alerting key holders of upcoming protocol upgrade or role permissioning proposals going through Governance;</li>\n<li>Managing required timelines;</li>\n<li>Scheduling, setting agendas, and hosting Council meetings and facilitating discussions;</li>\n<li>Monitoring compliance with the procedures;</li>\n<li>Onboarding new Council participants; and</li>\n<li>Communicating with external stakeholders, including Optimism Governance, as to Council operations. All Security Council participants are expected to perform these responsibilities with the awareness that OP Chains, the OP Stack, the developing Superchain, and the associated products, tools, and documentation are in a rapidly evolving nascent state. To the extent that unforeseeable circumstances or ambiguities arise (including in connection with potential responses to Exception Events), the participants will work in good faith to resolve them consistent with this Charter and the Law of Chains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, all Security Council participants are also responsible for complying with (i) the Code of Conduct of the Optimism Collective and (ii) any additional, internal conflict of interest procedures that the Council may develop from time to time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"accountability-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#accountability-14\"></a><strong>Accountability</strong></h3>\n<p>The Security Council is accountable to Optimism Governance. The Token House may vote to remove Security Council members at any time for severe violations of the Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>The Security Council can also act unilaterally to remove a participant who fails to satisfy the requirements of this Charter if such failure falls within the defined scope of the Council\u2019s emergency powers (see \u201cStructure \u2013 Emergency Response\u201d above).</p>\n<p>Governance votes for removal of a Security Council participant for violation of the Code of Conduct will occur before the end of the next voting cycle (a delay of 3 weeks maximum). A contingent vote for their replacement on the Council will run in the same voting cycle.</p>\n<p>Security Council members may be removed for failure to satisfy the requirements of this Charter immediately via an Emergency Response. A vote for their replacement on the Council would run in the next nearest voting cycle.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if a Security Council key holder fails to prove access to their keys by satisfying the requirements of a scheduled liveness check (see \u201cParticipants \u2013 Responsibilities,\u201d above), that participant will be automatically removed from the Council. A vote for their replacement on the Council would run in the next nearest voting cycle.</p>\n<p>Any time a key holder is removed from the Council, the threshold may also be reduced to as long as the ratio of the threshold to the number of signers remains above 75%. If the number of signers is reduced below 8, then a safety mechanism is activated which hands control of the Security Council to the Foundation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"budget-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#budget-15\"></a><strong>Budget</strong></h3>\n<p>Initially, the Optimism Foundation will cover member expenses and may provide members with a stipend. The Security Council will not request a budget from the Governance Fund at this time.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"iteration-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#iteration-16\"></a><strong>Iteration</strong></h2>\n<p>The canonical version of the Charter will be published to GitHub. Any material updates to the Charter will be reflected with a new version number at the top of this document, at which point the updated version will go into effect.</p>\n<p>For clarity, however, this Charter cannot be altered in any way that would have the effect of fundamentally altering the security model of an OP Chain or constitute a de facto protocol upgrade (both of which require an Optimism Governance vote).</p>\n<p>It should finally be reiterated that the role of the Security Council is intended to be progressively and programmatically reduced over time, as its functionalities are no longer needed or can be effectively managed directly by Governance. Ultimately, it is the goal of the Collective and this Council that we reach a state of protocol and governance reliability that allows for the full deprecation of the Council\u2019s multisig, and the full and final dissolution of the Council.</p>"}}

This creates long-term incentive alignment between the grant recipient and the Collective, and helps reinforce OP\u2019s function as a governance token.</p>\n<p>However, this situation creates barriers for teams that need immediate access to capital. If you\u2019re trying to make payroll, pay for infrastructure costs, or are dependent on grants to extend your team\u2019s runway, a grant of locked OP is insufficient. Some of the most promising grants (novel use cases) need access to upfront capital the most. In Season 3, we identified several promising builders in this category that were prevented from applying for Token House grants as a result.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"co-match-the-collective-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#co-match-the-collective-4\"></a>Co-match the Collective!</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://Syndicate.io\">Syndicate.io</a> is building a custom grant-matching contract so that you can support the work being done in the Token House and build an on-chain record of your contribution. Matching contracts allow co-granters to contribute USDC to a single contract to pro-rata \u201cmatch\u201d builders grants made by the Grants Council. Here\u2019s how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enter the amount you\u2019d like to co-grant and submit your contribution. Your co-grant proceeds will flow directly to the matching contract. In Season 4, matching contract distributions will be executed according to the decisions of the Grants Council (if renewed.)</li>\n<li>As the Grants Council makes grants, your co-grant will be similarly distributed until the matching contract runs out or until Season 4 ends on September 20th (tentative.)</li>\n<li>You\u2019ll receive a co-grantor NFT and an Optimism Attestation to signify your support of the Collective as a Token House co-granter.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"why-should-i-match-upfront-capital-as-a-public-good-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#why-should-i-match-upfront-capital-as-a-public-good-5\"></a>Why should I match? Upfront Capital as a Public Good</h3>\n<p>The Token House plays a critical role in bootstrapping a profitable market for public goods. Token House grants provide certain, upfront funding while a reliable market for RetroPGF further develops in the Citizens\u2019 House. Together, the two houses of the Collective create a powerful flywheel, funding public goods that make Optimism blockspace more valuable, leading to more revenue for public goods, and so on.Co-granting is a unique opportunity to provide the upfront capital required to kickstart this flywheel.</p>\n<p>Given the importance of this contribution to the development of the Collective, you will receive both a co-grantor NFT and Optimism Attestation, enabling your on-chain reputation to reflect your impact.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"faq-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#faq-6\"></a>FAQ</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Can I withdraw or edit the amount of my funds after they\u2019ve been deposited?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Not in Season 4.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>What if the Grants Council is not renewed?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Matching contracts will not go live before the vote to renew the Council has occurred.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>What if there is funding left in the matching contract at the end of Season 4?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>If any funding remains in the matching contract at the end of Season 4, it will be sent back to the Governance Fund to fund grants made in future Seasons.

You can see Council Grants in <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-10-final-grants-roundup/5418\">Cycle 10</a> and <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-11-final-grants-roundup/5842\">Cycle 11</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Grants will continue to be made by the Grants Council in Season 4.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"limited-by-access-to-upfront-capital-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#limited-by-access-to-upfront-capital-3\"></a>Limited by Access to Upfront Capital</h3>\n<p>All builders grants made by the Token House are granted in the form of OP that is locked for a period of one year. This creates long-term incentive alignment between the grant recipient and the Collective, and helps reinforce OP\u2019s function as a governance token.</p>\n<p>However, this situation creates barriers for teams that need immediate access to capital. If you\u2019re trying to make payroll, pay for infrastructure costs, or are dependent on grants to extend your team\u2019s runway, a grant of locked OP is insufficient. Some of the most promising grants (novel use cases) need access to upfront capital the most. In Season 3, we identified several promising builders in this category that were prevented from applying for Token House grants as a result.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"co-match-the-collective-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#co-match-the-collective-4\"></a>Co-match the Collective!</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://Syndicate.io\">Syndicate.io</a> is building a custom grant-matching contract so that you can support the work being done in the Token House and build an on-chain record of your contribution. Matching contracts allow co-granters to contribute USDC to a single contract to pro-rata \u201cmatch\u201d builders grants made by the Grants Council. Here\u2019s how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enter the amount you\u2019d like to co-grant and submit your contribution. Your co-grant proceeds will flow directly to the matching contract. In Season 4, matching contract distributions will be executed according to the decisions of the Grants Council (if renewed.)</li>\n<li>As the Grants Council makes grants, your co-grant will be similarly distributed until the matching contract runs out or until Season 4 ends on September 20th (tentative.)</li>\n<li>You\u2019ll receive a co-grantor NFT and an Optimism Attestation to signify your support of the Collective as a Token House co-granter.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"why-should-i-match-upfront-capital-as-a-public-good-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#why-should-i-match-upfront-capital-as-a-public-good-5\"></a>Why should I match? Upfront Capital as a Public Good</h3>\n<p>The Token House plays a critical role in bootstrapping a profitable market for public goods. Token House grants provide certain, upfront funding while a reliable market for RetroPGF further develops in the Citizens\u2019 House. Together, the two houses of the Collective create a powerful flywheel, funding public goods that make Optimism blockspace more valuable, leading to more revenue for public goods, and so on.Co-granting is a unique opportunity to provide the upfront capital required to kickstart this flywheel.</p>\n<p>Given the importance of this contribution to the development of the Collective, you will receive both a co-grantor NFT and Optimism Attestation, enabling your on-chain reputation to reflect your impact.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"faq-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#faq-6\"></a>FAQ</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Can I withdraw or edit the amount of my funds after they\u2019ve been deposited?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Not in Season 4.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>What if the Grants Council is not renewed?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Matching contracts will not go live before the vote to renew the Council has occurred.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>What if there is funding left in the matching contract at the end of Season 4?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>If any funding remains in the matching contract at the end of Season 4, it will be sent back to the Governance Fund to fund grants made in future Seasons. You can think of your co-grant as a donation to the Governance Fund.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Can I contribute an asset other than USDC?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Not in Season 4, but this capability may be added in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Should I expect a return on the capital contributed?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>These are grants, not for-profit investments, so you should not expect a return on your grant.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>How is the co-matching distributed to grant recipients?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Co-grants will be distributed among approved builders grants in which applicants checked a box on the application form indicating the need for upfront USDC. Co-grants will be matched among these grants on a \u201cpro-rata\u201d basis based on the overall budget to be distributed as builders grants for Season 4 (3M OP.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"}}

I was expecting to make some deal around the OP that would help these teams, but I never did and I won\u2019t do it if there is clarity given that it is against the rules.</p>\n<p>IMO, just to be practical, <strong>I think it would be great to enable people who contribute financially to making sure that projects can be executed on can be rewarded with OP as well</strong> (this is one of the places where I would add value to these teams), financial contribution is a contribution that should be considered alongside labor, expertise and time, but if that is not an option, we can abide by the clarity given, and I won\u2019t create any deal for being rewarded with OP for financial contributions.</p>\n<p><strong>The other thing that needs clarity is\u2026</strong></p>\n<p><strong>When the 1 year lock up is over, the OP can be split up amongst the team members correct?</strong> And different team members can receive different amounts based on their contributions to the project?</p>\n<p>For instance, in the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-fueling-retropgf-growth-through-education-collaboration-and-active-marketing/6146/25\">RetroPGF marketing proposal</a>, Bankless Academy has their role, and the Giveth &amp; General Magic teams have their role.</p>\n<p>Are we allowed to set expectations between the teams on how much OP goes to Bankless Academy for building the course, and how much goes to Giveth for running the booths, coordinating the sponsorships in person and supervising the content production &amp; how much goes to GM for doing the design work, brand guidelines, shooting/editing videos and doing the general project coordination?</p>\n<p>I assume that is ok, and want to confirm, because this is how I assumed Alliances would work, that they would form for the life of the project and after the year they could split the OP amongst the contributing teams.</p>"}}

Any effective sales that have occurred to date are a violation enforceable via the Code of Conduct. Going forward, the Foundation also has the ability to enforce the grant policies (but does not have that ability retroactively.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Prohibited from approving and voting on own proposals YET 2) with some exception where approval voting specified in relation to elections? Yet approval voting is also specified and the method applied for Collective Intents</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although the Code of Conduct has not yet been updated to reflect this clarification, we clarified in Discord that the exception for approval voting for elections does not apply to Missions (Missions are not elections, therefore the exception does not apply. However, since this was not pre-specified, voting according to the policy outlined for elections should not be viewed as a violation of the Code of Conduct in Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#13</span>.)</p>\n<p>Additional clarifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Foundation counts delegate approvals (and verifies they are made by delegates with enough voting power) and adds proposals with the required approvals to a voting roundup 24 hours prior to the vote. That gives everyone time to correct any mistakes in including or not including a proposal. The Foundation did not count Griff\u2019s approval in instances in which he explicitly highlighted his involvement with a proposal when providing an approval. There is no problem with a delegate expressing support for their own proposal; that is distinct from providing an explicit approval for the proposal to move to a vote.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As stated in Discord, delegates are prohibited from approving and voting on their own proposals, with the exception of voting in elections that utilize approval voting.

Any effective sales that have occurred to date are a violation enforceable via the Code of Conduct. Going forward, the Foundation also has the ability to enforce the grant policies (but does not have that ability retroactively.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Prohibited from approving and voting on own proposals YET 2) with some exception where approval voting specified in relation to elections? Yet approval voting is also specified and the method applied for Collective Intents</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although the Code of Conduct has not yet been updated to reflect this clarification, we clarified in Discord that the exception for approval voting for elections does not apply to Missions (Missions are not elections, therefore the exception does not apply. However, since this was not pre-specified, voting according to the policy outlined for elections should not be viewed as a violation of the Code of Conduct in Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#13</span>.)</p>\n<p>Additional clarifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Foundation counts delegate approvals (and verifies they are made by delegates with enough voting power) and adds proposals with the required approvals to a voting roundup 24 hours prior to the vote. That gives everyone time to correct any mistakes in including or not including a proposal. The Foundation did not count Griff\u2019s approval in instances in which he explicitly highlighted his involvement with a proposal when providing an approval. There is no problem with a delegate expressing support for their own proposal; that is distinct from providing an explicit approval for the proposal to move to a vote.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As stated in Discord, delegates are prohibited from approving and voting on their own proposals, with the exception of voting in elections that utilize approval voting. Doing so is a violation of the approving delegate, not the proposer relying on their approval. I believe there are three approved proposals that were reliant on Griff\u2019s approval to move to a vote; I do not believe they should be penalized.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The enforcement actions that apply for all of these violatons are to file a code of conduct violation report against the delegate that has violated the Code of Conduct.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Voting for one\u2019s own proposal is a violation of the Code of Conduct, so if Griff voted for proposals in which he is listed as an Alliance member, that would be a violation.

Committees attempt to solve the following problems:</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"h-1-information-overload-for-delegates-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#h-1-information-overload-for-delegates-3\"></a>1. Information Overload for Delegates</h3>\n<p>There are currently a lot of proposals to be voted on by Token House delegates. Even for delegates that are very familiar with the context of these proposals and their applications, processing all these proposals is unsustainable. Providing feedback on proposal drafts and engaging on forum posts, while voting on active proposals, is currently an unmanageable workload for many delegates.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"h-2-purpose-mismatch-for-delegates-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#h-2-purpose-mismatch-for-delegates-4\"></a>2. Purpose Mismatch for Delegates</h3>\n<p>Delegates have different areas of specialty. While the majority of proposals to date have been related to DeFi, some delegates specialize in non-DeFi related topics such as public goods, tooling, and L2 infrastructure. These delegates don\u2019t feel well-equipped to vote on DeFi proposals or aren\u2019t interested in doing so.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"why-committees-should-solve-these-problems-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#why-committees-should-solve-these-problems-5\"></a>Why committees should solve these problems</h3>\n<p>This problem may be alleviated by segmenting the work of assessing proposals among smaller, focused groups (\u201dcommittees\u201d). These committees will primarily perform information filtering and synthesis so that delegates aren\u2019t overloaded with information. Delegates that specialize in a particular topic can defer to the recommendation of relevant committees on topics outside their area of expertise/interest.</p>\n<h1>\n<a name=\"introducing-committees-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#introducing-committees-6\"></a><strong>Introducing committees</strong>\n</h1>\n<p>In Season 2, we will experiment with a new proposal type: committee formation.</p>\n<p>Committee formation proposals may only be submitted by delegates with &gt;0.5% of voting power and will be accepted only for Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag\">#5</span>, requiring submission before 7p GMT on Aug 25 in order to be included in Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag\">#5</span>. There is no requirement for all committee members to have &gt;0.5% of votable supply, but at least one member must in order to submit the proposal. Phase 1 committee formation proposals should follow <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/phase-1-committee-formation-proposal-template/3281\">this template</a> and should be posted for feedback 1 week in advance of the start of Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag\">#5</span>. This proposal type may be added to the operating manual in Season 3.</p>\n<p>A maximum of 4 committee formation proposals will be ratified for the duration of Season 2. Up to 4 committee proposals (measured by OP voting \u201cYes\u201d) will be implemented at the start of Season 2 (with Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag\">#6</span>) on Sept 8. If more than 4 committees are proposed, the 4 committees with the most votes will be implemented. Votes will be ranked across all categories. We would like to encourage a diversity of committee types and recommend delegates only vote \u201cyes\u201d for their top 1-2 committees in each category.</p>\n<p>Committees will operate primarily via social contract and, apart from governance-approved OP rewards for committee participation, will not directly manage tokens. Instead, committees will vet, research, and discuss proposals, then make highly visible recommendations to non-committee delegates at the time of voting. Committee members will receive OP rewards to incentivize this work.</p>\n<p>By approving a committee, <strong>delegates are entering a social contract to entrust and delegate the bulk of decision-making to the committee.</strong> They are expected to follow the recommendation of committees, except in extreme circumstances, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>undisclosed conflict-of-interest by the committee</li>\n<li>perceived corruption or self-dealing</li>\n<li>suspected operational security compromise/committee accounts hacked</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Committee members may vote against the recommendation of their own committee, but recommendations should include a list of any dissenting committee members along with their reasoning.</p>\n<p>Delegates not serving on committees will still be responsible for signing all their own votes. If delegates vote against the recommendation of the committee, they will be expected to post their reasoning in the forum roundup thread. To address concerns about a drop-off in non-committee delegate participation, the Optimism Foundation will track this data and re-evaluate the structure of committees if we see a meaningful decrease.</p>\n<p>We believe this approach will address the feedback we received in Season 1 in a governance-minimized way, limiting the complexity introduced into voting or proposal processes. The Foundation will continue to handle the administrative work of sending OP to governance-approved grant recipients, as in Season 1.</p>\n<h1>\n<a name=\"foundation-recommendations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#foundation-recommendations-7\"></a>Foundation Recommendations</h1>\n<p>While it\u2019s the Token House\u2019s ultimate decision on what this season\u2019s four committees should specialize in, our initial recommendation is: <strong>2 DeFi</strong> committees specializing in different focus areas, <strong>NFTs</strong>, and <strong>Tooling.</strong> If 4 committees are not necessary, fewer committees may be approved.</p>\n<p>We have updated the cap on the number of committees to accommodate the potential creation of two distinct DeFi committees. In the event that two DeFi committees are approved, each committee should handle proposals related to distinct focus areas. If &gt;1 DeFi committee proposal is submitted, each committee should specify an area of specialization so that there would not be a case where two committees are making recommendations on the same proposal. While committees may provide recommendations for proposals that fall outside their domain, only the recommendation of the most directly relevant committee will be surfaced and included on Snapshot. In the event that there is a proposal that does not fall clearly within any of the approved committees, it will be up to the committees to decide which committee will provide a recommendation.</p>\n<p>These committees will dissolve at the end of Season 2, and the following Reflection Period will allow the Token House to renew existing committees or propose new ones.</p>\n<p>We put forward the following guidelines for committees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each committee must consist of a <strong>Committee Lead</strong> and up to 4 other Committee Members. Committee Leads will be responsible for general coordination of the committee and publishing recommendation analyses on behalf of the committee.</li>\n<li>Committees will self-determine how they reach consensus on the recommendations that are put forward to delegates. This process may be different across committees.</li>\n<li>Committees will be expected to operate transparently by communicating in open channels and sharing information in public forums. Even if decision-making processes differ, they should communicate similar information in a consistent place.</li>\n<li>Committees will also be expected to publish a report on their process, learnings, and outcomes at the end of the Season.</li>\n<li>If something is not clearly outlined in this post or the operating manual, committees have decision making authority over their own operations, and may decide to make exceptions for proposers at their discretion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on Reflection Period feedback, we are recommending the following compensation structure. This will be paid out of the Governance Fund in $OP.</p>\n<p>Each of the approved committees will receive a base level of rewards in the amount of $10k equivalent in $OP, to be distributed among committee members. This budget is meant to support 5 committee members, including a committee lead. Since workload is unlikely to be standardized across committees, at the end of the season, an additional $10k equivalent per committee in $OP rewards will be allocated between committees based on relative workload and contribution during the season. <strong>Please note that all committee members that receive compensation will need to be KYC\u2019d. KYC information will be collected privately by the Optimism Foundation.</strong></p>\n<p>Similar compensation discussions in other communities frequently gets heated and becomes unproductive. For this reason, and to avoid unnecessary conflict, <strong>the Optimism Foundation will make the final decision on committee compensation for Season 2.</strong> If the community feels that this structure is severely off the mark, they can voice that during this Reflection Period, but the Optimism Foundation will override if discussion becomes unproductive or loses civility.

Rather than deep diving into every proposal, those in a committee will only need to go deep into one segment of the proposals, and those not in a committee will have, it seems very little to do.</p>\n<p>As everyone\u2019s workload is going to be reducing the introduction of compensation seems interesting. Obviously no one would say no to getting paid, but I wonder how necessary it is to set this before we know what the level of workload will be. Thinking about your 3rd question of accountability, might it make more sense to allocate funds to the different teams at the end of the season? I\u2019m thinking in particular that it might be that, for example, the DeFi committee has been going flat out with dozens and dozens of proposals to work through, while the Tooling team had a whole 2 weeks off with nothing that fitted into their specialism for a voting round?</p>\n<p>Also worth considering is that there might be something of a centralization risk around giving the non-committee members too little to do. If delegates feel like they are effectively just rubber stamping the decisions of the committees then it seems likely we will see a drop off of engagement.

Thinking about your 3rd question of accountability, might it make more sense to allocate funds to the different teams at the end of the season? I\u2019m thinking in particular that it might be that, for example, the DeFi committee has been going flat out with dozens and dozens of proposals to work through, while the Tooling team had a whole 2 weeks off with nothing that fitted into their specialism for a voting round?</p>\n<p>Also worth considering is that there might be something of a centralization risk around giving the non-committee members too little to do.

This post will serve as a discussion thread to solve for one of the biggest challenges faced by the Token House so far. The main idea is to reduce delegate overload by introducing a notion of \u201ccommittees\u201d which are tasked by the collective to focus on specific subsets of proposals.</p>\n<p><strong>If approved, this proposal will remain in effect for one season (~3 months)\u2014think of it as an experiment. This will allow for testing and reflection on whether or not committees are beneficial to the governance process before making any decisions that are difficult to reverse.</strong></p>\n<h2>Problems to Solve</h2>\n<p>We heard lots of feedback from community members and delegates throughout Season 1. Committees attempt to solve the following problems:</p>\n<h3>1. Information Overload for Delegates</h3>\n<p>There are currently a lot of proposals to be voted on by Token House delegates. Even for delegates that are very familiar with the context of these proposals and their applications, processing all these proposals is unsustainable. Providing feedback on proposal drafts and engaging on forum posts, while voting on active proposals, is currently an unmanageable workload for many delegates.</p>\n<h3>2. Purpose Mismatch for Delegates</h3>\n<p>Delegates have different areas of specialty. While the majority of proposals to date have been related to DeFi, some delegates specialize in non-DeFi related topics such as public goods, tooling, and L2 infrastructure. These delegates don\u2019t feel well-equipped to vote on DeFi proposals or aren\u2019t interested in doing so.</p>\n<h3>Why committees should solve these problems</h3>\n<p>This problem may be alleviated by segmenting the work of assessing proposals among smaller, focused groups (\u201dcommittees\u201d). These committees will primarily perform information filtering and synthesis so that delegates aren\u2019t overloaded with information. Delegates that specialize in a particular topic can defer to the recommendation of relevant committees on topics outside their area of expertise/interest.</p>\n<h1><strong>Introducing committees</strong></h1>\n<p>In Season 2, we will experiment with a new proposal type: committee formation.</p>\n<p>Committee formation proposals may only be submitted by delegates with &gt;0.5% of voting power and will be accepted only for Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#5</span>, requiring submission before 7p GMT on Aug 25 in order to be included in Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#5</span>. There is no requirement for all committee members to have &gt;0.5% of votable supply, but at least one member must in order to submit the proposal. Phase 1 committee formation proposals should follow <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/phase-1-committee-formation-proposal-template/3281\">this template</a> and should be posted for feedback 1 week in advance of the start of Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#5</span>. This proposal type may be added to the operating manual in Season 3.</p>\n<p>A maximum of 4 committee formation proposals will be ratified for the duration of Season 2. Up to 4 committee proposals (measured by OP voting \u201cYes\u201d) will be implemented at the start of Season 2 (with Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#6</span>) on Sept 8. If more than 4 committees are proposed, the 4 committees with the most votes will be implemented. Votes will be ranked across all categories. We would like to encourage a diversity of committee types and recommend delegates only vote \u201cyes\u201d for their top 1-2 committees in each category.</p>\n<p>Committees will operate primarily via social contract and, apart from governance-approved OP rewards for committee participation, will not directly manage tokens. Instead, committees will vet, research, and discuss proposals, then make highly visible recommendations to non-committee delegates at the time of voting. Committee members will receive OP rewards to incentivize this work.</p>\n<p>By approving a committee, <strong>delegates are entering a social contract to entrust and delegate the bulk of decision-making to the committee.</strong> They are expected to follow the recommendation of committees, except in extreme circumstances, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>undisclosed conflict-of-interest by the committee</li>\n<li>perceived corruption or self-dealing</li>\n<li>suspected operational security compromise/committee accounts hacked</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Committee members may vote against the recommendation of their own committee, but recommendations should include a list of any dissenting committee members along with their reasoning.</p>\n<p>Delegates not serving on committees will still be responsible for signing all their own votes. If delegates vote against the recommendation of the committee, they will be expected to post their reasoning in the forum roundup thread. To address concerns about a drop-off in non-committee delegate participation, the Optimism Foundation will track this data and re-evaluate the structure of committees if we see a meaningful decrease.</p>\n<p>We believe this approach will address the feedback we received in Season 1 in a governance-minimized way, limiting the complexity introduced into voting or proposal processes. The Foundation will continue to handle the administrative work of sending OP to governance-approved grant recipients, as in Season 1.</p>\n<h1>Foundation Recommendations</h1>\n<p>While it\u2019s the Token House\u2019s ultimate decision on what this season\u2019s four committees should specialize in, our initial recommendation is: <strong>2 DeFi</strong> committees specializing in different focus areas, <strong>NFTs</strong>, and <strong>Tooling.</strong> If 4 committees are not necessary, fewer committees may be approved.</p>\n<p>We have updated the cap on the number of committees to accommodate the potential creation of two distinct DeFi committees. In the event that two DeFi committees are approved, each committee should handle proposals related to distinct focus areas. If &gt;1 DeFi committee proposal is submitted, each committee should specify an area of specialization so that there would not be a case where two committees are making recommendations on the same proposal. While committees may provide recommendations for proposals that fall outside their domain, only the recommendation of the most directly relevant committee will be surfaced and included on Snapshot. In the event that there is a proposal that does not fall clearly within any of the approved committees, it will be up to the committees to decide which committee will provide a recommendation.</p>\n<p>These committees will dissolve at the end of Season 2, and the following Reflection Period will allow the Token House to renew existing committees or propose new ones.</p>\n<p>We put forward the following guidelines for committees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each committee must consist of a <strong>Committee Lead</strong> and up to 4 other Committee Members. Committee Leads will be responsible for general coordination of the committee and publishing recommendation analyses on behalf of the committee.</li>\n<li>Committees will self-determine how they reach consensus on the recommendations that are put forward to delegates. This process may be different across committees.</li>\n<li>Committees will be expected to operate transparently by communicating in open channels and sharing information in public forums. Even if decision-making processes differ, they should communicate similar information in a consistent place.</li>\n<li>Committees will also be expected to publish a report on their process, learnings, and outcomes at the end of the Season.</li>\n<li>If something is not clearly outlined in this post or the operating manual, committees have decision making authority over their own operations, and may decide to make exceptions for proposers at their discretion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on Reflection Period feedback, we are recommending the following compensation structure. This will be paid out of the Governance Fund in $OP.</p>\n<p>Each of the approved committees will receive a base level of rewards in the amount of $10k equivalent in $OP, to be distributed among committee members. This budget is meant to support 5 committee members, including a committee lead. Since workload is unlikely to be standardized across committees, at the end of the season, an additional $10k equivalent per committee in $OP rewards will be allocated between committees based on relative workload and contribution during the season. <strong>Please note that all committee members that receive compensation will need to be KYC\u2019d. KYC information will be collected privately by the Optimism Foundation.</strong></p>\n<p>Similar compensation discussions in other communities frequently gets heated and becomes unproductive. For this reason, and to avoid unnecessary conflict, <strong>the Optimism Foundation will make the final decision on committee compensation for Season 2.</strong> If the community feels that this structure is severely off the mark, they can voice that during this Reflection Period, but the Optimism Foundation will override if discussion becomes unproductive or loses civility. Incentives for non-committee delegates is out of scope for Season 2, but something on the roadmap for Season 3.</p>\n<h1>Open Questions</h1>\n<p>What would the community like to see in the proposal template for the creation of a new committee? \u2192 You can provide feedback on the Phase 1 Committee Formation Proposal Template <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/phase-1-committee-formation-proposal-template/3281\">here</a></p>\n<p>What is the best way for committees to communicate with each other and with non-committee delegates to maximize transparency? \u2192 this is something to be specified in the proposal template</p>\n<p>What is the best mechanism by which to hold committees accountable at the end of, and during, a season?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Hello everyone, did anyone tell me that the Optimism token will be used to pay the commission? it\u2019s true?</p>\n<p>thanks in advance <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiling_face_with_three_hearts.png?v=12\" title=\":smiling_face_with_three_hearts:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiling_face_with_three_hearts:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/moneymandoug\">@MoneyManDoug</a></p>", "post_number": 77, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2023-01-17T12:18:41.706Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 1, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 33, "readers_count": 32, "score": 6.6, "yours": false, "topic_id": 3238, "topic_slug": "introducing-governance-committees", "display_username": "pelka", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "flair_group_id": null, "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": true, "user_title": "", "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 6874, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 0, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": false}, "subpath": ["19056"], "author": "platko", "creation_time": "2023-01-17T12:18:41.706000+00:00", "content": "<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"ben-chain\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"3238\" data-full=\"true\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/b/b5a626/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> ben-chain:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Committees</h1>\n<p>Hello community! This post will serve as a discussion thread to solve for one of the biggest challenges faced by the Token House so far. The main idea is to reduce delegate overload by introducing a notion of \u201ccommittees\u201d which are tasked by the collective to focus on specific subsets of proposals.</p>\n<p><strong>If approved, this proposal will remain in effect for one season (~3 months)\u2014think of it as an experiment. This will allow for testing and reflection on whether or not committees are beneficial to the governance process before making any decisions that are difficult to reverse.</strong></p>\n<h2>Problems to Solve</h2>\n<p>We heard lots of feedback from community members and delegates throughout Season 1.

The winner of the L2 wars will be decided ultimately by how efficiently the network can allocate capital)</li>\n<li>Is the proposal prescriptive enough to prevent mis-use of $OP token funding and does it drive sustainable ecosystem growth?</li>\n<li>Amount of OP requested (with ROI taken into account)</li>\n<li>Whether or not the project has launched on Optimism (and if OP native)</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please describe how the committee will operate:</strong></p>\n<p>A private group on Discord will be created for committee members to discuss each proposal. Once all queries have been raised , the committee will decide its recommendation by a simple majority vote. A committee member will draft a brief summary and recommendation utilizing a Notion workspace allowing for other committee members to comment and edit before publishing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will publish our recommendations for voting under a NFT &amp; gaming committee thread within the Optimism forum</li>\n<li>If the timing works out we will also share our findings and recommendations during our weekly Web3 Experience Twitter Spaces each Monday at 7pm ET.</li>\n</ul>"}}

My primary takeaway is that we at the Foundation need to be doing a better job engaging with the community on the post-Bedrock roadmap. With Bedrock significantly simplifying the protocol, the path towards implementing many of the improvements you\u2019ve listed becomes much more straightforward. We clearly haven\u2019t talked publicly enough about this, and will work to correct that (in longer form prose) in the near future.</p>\n<p>Speaking in my personal capacity, I\u2019d say that, of the three points above, a security council seems like the lowest hanging fruit, with sequencer decentralization as a fast follow.</p>\n<p>As for semi-permissioned fault proofs, I see this as a potentially useful milestone, but not as an outcome in and of itself. I want to emphasize the importance of a \u201cweakest-link\u201d security mindset and <strong>am wary of creating a false sense of security</strong> by implementing gadgets which do not fundamentally change the security model. At worst, these gadgets may even harm it by introducing complexity.

If &gt;1 DeFi committee proposal is submitted, each committee should specify an area of specialization so that there would not be a case where two committees are making recommendations on the same proposal. While committees may provide recommendations for proposals that fall outside their domain, only the recommendation of the most directly relevant committee will be surfaced and included on Snapshot. In the event that there is a proposal that does not fall clearly within any of the approved committees, it will be up to the committees to decide which committee will provide a recommendation.\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Meet with your committee!</p>\n<p>Remember, Committee Leads will be responsible for general coordination of the committee but it is up to each committee how they choose to operate day-to-day. Committees will determine their own decision making frameworks and processes by which they come to consensus but are expected to make these public. Any updates to committee formation proposals should be noted in a comment within the proposal thread.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Establish clear communication channels</p>\n<p>Committees may use private channels to coordinate basic committee operations but committees are expected to operate as transparently as possible by communicating with proposers and delegates in open channels and sharing information in public forums.

While committees may choose to provide recommendations for proposals that fall outside their domain, committees should primarily focus on recommendations that fall within their scope.

The Governance Fund should support the migration of trusted, proven applications currently deployed on L1s.</p>\n<p><strong>Grow population of values-aligned builders:</strong> To be the home for the next wave of novel applications, the Governance Fund should support developers launching novel applications that will draw new users to Optimism.</p>\n<p>If the grant does not help the Governance Fund achieve either of the above goals, delegates should provide that feedback to proposers and consider not approving the proposal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Committees should publicly post the list of proposals they plan to review, preferably in their discord channel, at the start of Week 2 so proposers are aware of whether or not their proposal is being considered</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Committee Leads should post committee recommendations in the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/c/proposals/38\">Proposal Discussion</a> section of the forum</p>\n<p>Threads should be titled [Committee NAME + LETTER: Season X Recommendations].

If &gt;1 DeFi committee proposal is submitted, each committee should specify an area of specialization so that there would not be a case where two committees are making recommendations on the same proposal. While committees may provide recommendations for proposals that fall outside their domain, only the recommendation of the most directly relevant committee will be surfaced and included on Snapshot. In the event that there is a proposal that does not fall clearly within any of the approved committees, it will be up to the committees to decide which committee will provide a recommendation.\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Meet with your committee!</p>\n<p>Remember, Committee Leads will be responsible for general coordination of the committee but it is up to each committee how they choose to operate day-to-day. Committees will determine their own decision making frameworks and processes by which they come to consensus but are expected to make these public. Any updates to committee formation proposals should be noted in a comment within the proposal thread.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Establish clear communication channels</p>\n<p>Committees may use private channels to coordinate basic committee operations but committees are expected to operate as transparently as possible by communicating with proposers and delegates in open channels and sharing information in public forums.

I made a suggestion to be a committee for another vertical more aligned with your backgrounds. i\u2019m not really sure how i could possibly be more constructive.</p>\n<p>I love EthernautDAO. Was talking about it yesterday with a colleague and wanted to see about engaging you all. What you do is great, and there are many ways outside defi your particular expertise can be brought to bear. tooling, community, devrel, infra would all benefit from your perspective.</p>\n<p>Our jobs here are to help Optimism thrive and win \u2013 that might not necessarily come in the ways we expect. i recommend you take my suggestion productively and reconsider your position.</p>"}}

Committees attempt to solve the following problems:</p>\n<h3>1. Information Overload for Delegates</h3>\n<p>There are currently a lot of proposals to be voted on by Token House delegates. Even for delegates that are very familiar with the context of these proposals and their applications, processing all these proposals is unsustainable. Providing feedback on proposal drafts and engaging on forum posts, while voting on active proposals, is currently an unmanageable workload for many delegates.</p>\n<h3>2. Purpose Mismatch for Delegates</h3>\n<p>Delegates have different areas of specialty. While the majority of proposals to date have been related to DeFi, some delegates specialize in non-DeFi related topics such as public goods, tooling, and L2 infrastructure. These delegates don\u2019t feel well-equipped to vote on DeFi proposals or aren\u2019t interested in doing so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Diminishing people capacity, expertise, ability to work in a specific committee was completely pointless in the first place.

community members and delegates throughout Season 1. Committees attempt to solve the following problems:</p>\n<h3>1. Information Overload for Delegates</h3>\n<p>There are currently a lot of proposals to be voted on by Token House delegates. Even for delegates that are very familiar with the context of these proposals and their applications, processing all these proposals is unsustainable. Providing feedback on proposal drafts and engaging on forum posts, while voting on active proposals, is currently an unmanageable workload for many delegates.</p>\n<h3>2. Purpose Mismatch for Delegates</h3>\n<p>Delegates have different areas of specialty. While the majority of proposals to date have been related to DeFi, some delegates specialize in non-DeFi related topics such as public goods, tooling, and L2 infrastructure. These delegates don\u2019t feel well-equipped to vote on DeFi proposals or aren\u2019t interested in doing so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Diminishing people capacity, expertise, ability to work in a specific committee was completely pointless in the first place. I didn\u2019t need to read all this BS but thanks. Now I know I don\u2019t want to be part of this kind of DAO.</p>"}}

any.</p>\n<p>Additionally, all the relevant information and research about the project, its proposal and any needed context will be properly explained, so each delegate and community can have high guarantees of understanding and decision-making even if it is not their expertise.</p>\n<h1>\n<a name=\"please-describe-how-the-committee-will-operate-10\" class=\"anchor\"
