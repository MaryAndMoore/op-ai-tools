Means testing tries to understand the means a project has at their disposal and how reliant projects are on RetroPGF rewards to continue their work.  By rewarding with the expectation of future work, means testing leans more towards proactive grant giving. As the main experiment here is to reward contributions <em>retroactively</em>, RetroPGF 3 experiments with deprioritising collecting information relevant to means testing.

Means testing tries to understand the means a project has at their disposal and how reliant projects are on RetroPGF rewards to continue their work.  By rewarding with the expectation of future work, means testing leans more towards proactive grant giving. As the main experiment here is to reward contributions <em>retroactively</em>, RetroPGF 3 experiments with deprioritising collecting information relevant to means testing. If badgeholders finds this to be limiting in reviewing projects for RetroPGF 3, the Collective may iterate on this in future rounds.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"call-for-feedback-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#call-for-feedback-5\"></a>Call for Feedback</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the application form provide a smooth experience for applicants?

The more well known a project is the more potential it has for some points allocation by the majority of voters/badgeholders just due to its name. Let\u2019s take Safe as an example (notice: I invested in them so right now I am fighting <strong>against my own interests</strong>) of a VC funded project that has raised a lot of money ($100m) and also participated in retroPGF (round 2).

Taking safe as an example, every badge holder will see it, say ah yes safe I know them. Let\u2019s send some points there.

Donations and grants are denominated in a few thousand of $ if the project is lucky. And they owe taxes on them too.

A common theme we noticed while reviewing Mission Requests, was confusion in regards to how well-defined the deliverables and the approach should be.</p>\n<p>For example, a Mission Request might be about researching alternative RPGF distribution methods.

Unless they are deemed critical upgrades or subjected to a one-package release, users should not be subjected to multiple changes to their systems, regardless of the nature of those changes. It can be argued that from the perspective of a developer or operator, implementing multiple changes simultaneously is more convenient. However, from a security and monitoring standpoint, addressing changes one at a time is more prudent. Nonetheless, it\u2019s worth noting that our pace of implementation remains significantly faster than Ethereum already.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>On <strong>Mission Requests and grants</strong>:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Now that we all have passed the first crafting mission requests experience, there\u2019s significant room for improvement in the scope, quality, and breadth of future proposed mission requests, moving beyond those tailored to very specific tasks. The Grants Council has performed excellently during cycle 19, ensuring the approval of suitable proposals, and we\u2019re doing our best for cycle 20 and so on. As delegates, our focus now shifts towards devising more impactful mission requests, as well as more professional description structures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I\u2019ve received feedback indicating confusion regarding the continuation of the Builder and Growth &amp; Experiments as mission requests. Some individuals were under the impression that these programs had concluded. Specifically, the Builder and Growth &amp; Experiments grants programs should be categorized/communicated better, either under the existing mission requests program or another designed in the future. Therefore, I recommend clarifying the distinction between \u201ctailored/tematic\u201d mission requests and these are more like \u201cfreestyle\u201d programs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Considering that badgeholders/citizens become involved towards the end of the process, where they assess the impact of the missions conducted, it seems prudent to encourage their participation or discussion during the preparation of mission requests. However, I am unsure of the best method to facilitate this, beyond acknowledging them as recognized community members.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The term \u2018baseline grant amount\u2019 was not always well understood among MR proposers and applicants. It is clearer to discuss in terms of \u2018maximum budget available\u2019 and \u2018maximum team applicants\u2019 only.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"strategy-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#strategy-2\"></a>Strategy</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Competence among Layer 2\u2019s chains is getting bigger, my feeling is that the pace of the current Grants conducted by the Governance is too slow for protocols to move properly, especially when it comes to user incentives, such as in DeFi. Thorough reviews are necessary, but opportunities for applications like these only arise a few times during the year (currently 4 periods, extrapolating Season 5 timeline into Season 6).This is not good. Surely, more continuous application periods would be beneficial. I hope to expand more on this case in the coming weeks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aligned marketing services are crucial here, in many cases we need to get the most competent teams for mission requests. Retro Funding alone does not appear to be a sufficient incentive to undertake such dedicated activities.

Unless they are deemed critical upgrades or subjected to a one-package release, users should not be subjected to multiple changes to their systems, regardless of the nature of those changes. It can be argued that from the perspective of a developer or operator, implementing multiple changes simultaneously is more convenient. However, from a security and monitoring standpoint, addressing changes one at a time is more prudent. Nonetheless, it\u2019s worth noting that our pace of implementation remains significantly faster than Ethereum already.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>On <strong>Mission Requests and grants</strong>:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Now that we all have passed the first crafting mission requests experience, there\u2019s significant room for improvement in the scope, quality, and breadth of future proposed mission requests, moving beyond those tailored to very specific tasks. The Grants Council has performed excellently during cycle 19, ensuring the approval of suitable proposals, and we\u2019re doing our best for cycle 20 and so on. As delegates, our focus now shifts towards devising more impactful mission requests, as well as more professional description structures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I\u2019ve received feedback indicating confusion regarding the continuation of the Builder and Growth &amp; Experiments as mission requests. Some individuals were under the impression that these programs had concluded. Specifically, the Builder and Growth &amp; Experiments grants programs should be categorized/communicated better, either under the existing mission requests program or another designed in the future. Therefore, I recommend clarifying the distinction between \u201ctailored/tematic\u201d mission requests and these are more like \u201cfreestyle\u201d programs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Considering that badgeholders/citizens become involved towards the end of the process, where they assess the impact of the missions conducted, it seems prudent to encourage their participation or discussion during the preparation of mission requests. However, I am unsure of the best method to facilitate this, beyond acknowledging them as recognized community members.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The term \u2018baseline grant amount\u2019 was not always well understood among MR proposers and applicants. It is clearer to discuss in terms of \u2018maximum budget available\u2019 and \u2018maximum team applicants\u2019 only.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"strategy-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#strategy-2\"></a>Strategy</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Competence among Layer 2\u2019s chains is getting bigger, my feeling is that the pace of the current Grants conducted by the Governance is too slow for protocols to move properly, especially when it comes to user incentives, such as in DeFi. Thorough reviews are necessary, but opportunities for applications like these only arise a few times during the year (currently 4 periods, extrapolating Season 5 timeline into Season 6).This is not good. Surely, more continuous application periods would be beneficial. I hope to expand more on this case in the coming weeks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aligned marketing services are crucial here, in many cases we need to get the most competent teams for mission requests. Retro Funding alone does not appear to be a sufficient incentive to undertake such dedicated activities. One alternative approach to alignment is to grant greater ownership to proposers and encourage them\u2014through attestations, rewards, points, whatever\u2014to disseminate information themselves.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863/6\">Collective Feedback Commission</a> takes these thoughts into consideration.

The process!</strong><br>\nIn as much as the process/design of this round is great, I feel like it doesn\u2019t fit in this round due to the number of applicants;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The ballot threshold</strong> - considering the No. of applicants, it seems to be overwhelming for this set of badge holders; over 600 projects (x3 RPGF2). This surely will leave less known or new projects with few or no ballots at all; we already seeing it as we have 5 more days to go.<br>\nWith this limited time, I feel most badge holders will put well-known projects above fewer projects in their ballots due to the time constraints (60 so far out of 644 projects).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The truth is most lesser projects are what give a boost to bigger projects; take for instance educators, if they do not keep talking/sharing their knowledge about these big protocols (with huge funding) with their communities and audience, how will people keep going to those protocols?</p>\n<p>For example, I have spent months writing updates about several projects in the superchain ecosystem (new, existing, and OP-funded projects), providing my audience insights on these projects on Mirror, Twitter, Lens, etc. <strong>See <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/ayohtunde.eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a></strong></p>\n<p>A lot of these protocols even rely on paying ambassadors to spread the word about their project; that\u2019s to tell how important educators are.<br>\nIf these small and underdog projects don\u2019t get the reward they deserve, there\u2019s really no motivation for them to keep contributing to the collective\u2026 even if they do, that\u2019s another whole year of supporting the collective before another RPGF round. Meanwhile, biggups to the badge holders noticing these small projects <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/saluting_face.png?v=12\" title=\":saluting_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":saluting_face:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The list</strong> - The lists are great but as we can see, only a small % of projects make the overall list so far. why?

Tools to Assist Your Review</strong><br>\nTo aid in your evaluation, I recommend three tools offering a quick overview of the ballot distribution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://retrolist.app/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Retrolist</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://retropgfhub.com/retropgf3/ballot\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RetroPGF Hub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.growthepie.xyz/optimism-retropgf-3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Growthetie\u2019s dahsboard</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These platforms can help identify projects that, though perhaps lesser-known, are deserving of your attention and support and might not have been included in many ballots.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

This creates a more dynamic and responsive ecosystem to various scales and types of contributions.</p>\n<p>Next, this separation allows for more detailed evaluation processes. Individual applications and projects will be assessed based on more relevant parameters and criteria to their scale and scope of contribution. This can enhance transparency and ensure that every type of effort, whether big or small, receives proportional attention.</p>\n<p>Finally, the benefit also lies in driving more active participation. Individual applications and projects might feel more motivated to contribute because they know there\u2019s a funding path tailored to their needs. This can enhance the overall appeal of the Retro Public Good Funding program and encourage sustainable growth in this ecosystem.</p>\n<p>So, by considering this separation for the next round, we can create a more inclusive, responsive environment and provide more precise support to contributors at various levels. Hopefully, this idea can enrich and further advance the Optimism ecosystem</p>"}}

We know that 132 of these 145 badgeholders have voted, but as we mentioned, this is irrelevant to the main point. However, the number of projects per badgeholder in this round has increased to 4.43. This doesn\u2019t mean that each badgeholder will review 4 projects. The most optimal impact measurement would be for each badgeholder to review every project in the round, but it\u2019s clearly impossible for each person to review 643 projects.</p>\n<p>Especially before this round began, we saw quite a lot of marketing moves and community updates related to this topic. We were expecting high participation. It\u2019s almost certain that participation in future rounds will be even higher. Let\u2019s not forget that 986 projects were eliminated during the review process. In fact, there were more than 1600 applications.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"solution-suggestion-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#solution-suggestion-2\"></a>Solution Suggestion</h2>\n<p>Considering all this, we need to increase the number of badgeholders. However, in doing so, we believe badgeholders should be trusted individuals who won\u2019t cheat in measuring impact. We need to increase the number with people who can continue to uphold this belief.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"minimum-ballot-quorum-and-popularity-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#minimum-ballot-quorum-and-popularity-3\"></a>Minimum Ballot Quorum and Popularity</h1>\n<p>As far as we know, there was no minimum vote quorum in the last round. However, this round, the 17 badgeholder ratio seemed quite high. The actual problem arose from our ability to track how many ballots each project was on. A lot of dashboards created were actively used during the voting process. Badgeholders, taking advantage of the full time allotted to them, tried to review as many projects as possible, hence they didn\u2019t create their ballots early on. As the end of the voting period approached, projects that realized they hadn\u2019t received votes from 17 badgeholders started a shilling race on Twitter, the Governance Forum, and Discord. This led to a rush to gain as much popularity as possible in order to surpass the ballot quorum at the earliest opportunity.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"solution-suggestion-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#solution-suggestion-4\"></a>Solution Suggestion</h2>\n<p>A project\u2019s presence on ballots should not be visible until after the voting process has ended. This way, projects would focus on marketing their projects throughout the entire voting period without overdoing it. The level of project shilling that disturbs badgeholders not only causes conflict among projects but also deteriorates the experience of the badgeholders</p>\n<h1><a name=\"fund-amount-that-project-need-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#fund-amount-that-project-need-5\"></a>Fund Amount That Project Need</h1>\n<p>Normally, in grant proposals, the amount of funding a project is requesting is included within the proposal itself. This is also the case for Missions happening within the Optimism ecosystem. Every project must outline what they will do, the timeline for doing it, and how much funding they need within the proposal.</p>\n<p>Now, as we have a retrospective perspective in RetroPGF rounds, instead of asking projects \u2018how much funding do you need?\u2019, we believe we should ask \u2018what costs did you encounter while creating this impact? What was the opportunity cost you lost in creating this impact?\u2019.</p>\n<p>This way, badgeholders will also have an idea of how much OP to allocate to projects. If there is an OP request, badgeholders can formulate thoughts like \u2018yes, they have created enough impact to deserve this OP/no, they don\u2019t deserve this OP for the impact they created, but they deserve half of it\u2019.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"solution-suggestion-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#solution-suggestion-6\"></a>Solution Suggestion</h2>\n<p>When projects apply for RetroPGF rounds, they should provide an additional piece of information: What is the cost associated with creating the impact? (This includes opportunity costs as well)</p>\n<h1><a name=\"vc-funded-projects-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#vc-funded-projects-7\"></a>VC Funded Projects</h1>\n<p>This became a widely discussed topic, especially on Twitter following Lefteris bringing it to attention. We observed that some projects have received more investment than the total amount of grants distributed in all RetroPGF rounds to date. The contribution of these projects to the Optimism ecosystem is an undeniable fact. However, as mentioned in previous points, in a design where you receive votes based on popularity, it\u2019s clear that funded and popular projects affect the grant amount that smaller public good projects can receive.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"solution-suggestion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#solution-suggestion-8\"></a>Solution Suggestion</h2>\n<p>We should not exclude these projects from the Optimism ecosystem, so as not to diminish their contribution. However, we cannot equate projects that have previously done fundraising with public good projects that sustain their economic viability through various grants. Therefore, we believe it would be appropriate to create a separate pool for VC funded projects in the next round\u2019s design.

Many still have a chance to earn more OP because a high score with 17 votes is more plausible than with +40 votes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better criteria &amp; communication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Communication improvement is essential. Many projects (<em><strong>and badgeholders</strong></em>) discovered the quorum of 17 <strong>during the allocation period</strong>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the review process in this round didn\u2019t seem communicative enough. Many projects were flagged by the Foundation and/or the Collective without much information. On one hand, this is positive because many applications were processed, but on the other hand, it\u2019s not fair to the projects not to provide a coherent justification for the flag. Another project I\u2019m part of was rejected, and I still don\u2019t exactly understand the reason for it (Optimism Portugues).</p>\n<p>I also believe allowing only 2-3 days for projects to appeal through a google form may not be the best option. Why not use the governance forum?</p>\n<p>Moreover, I still believe that the quorum of 17 for a project to be \u201cqualified\u201d is not a good idea. In the last 2-3 days, several projects and individuals tried to contact me, essentially begging to add the project to my ballot so they could reach 17. <strong>I think this is not positive for the project, badgeholders, or the Collective.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set realistic expectations for badgeholders</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The application said that \u201cacting as a voter in RetroPGF 3 requires a minimum time commitment of 5-10 hours.\u201d I know it said \u201cminimum\u201d, but the time was much longer than that.</p>\n<p>As mentioned by others, to do minimally acceptable work in this round, many hours of work were necessary, and 643 projects were at stake. There was no way to finish the work in 10 hours, especially if the badgeholder participated in pre-voting meetings.</p>\n<p>It would be better to align these expectations before the Round starts for badgeholders to better plan their votes.</p>\n<p>Also, the rule \u201cDo not DM badgeholders\u201d should be taken <strong>more seriously</strong>. As long as we let it continue the rule will continue to be broken. Certainly, part of this arises from the need for smaller projects to promote themselves to reach the minimum quorum of 17. But can\u2019t we create other forms of promotion/contact for these projects? <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/join-the-retropgf-projects-showcase/6979\">Proof of Integrity</a> conducted more than 7 initiatives for projects to present themselves; Why not do this on a larger scale?</p>\n<p>Another important point is that it is almost impossible to analyze all projects. We need to be more focused and assign people who know about the subject to evaluate it. For example, it\u2019s not useful for someone who doesn\u2019t know about development to evaluate development projects. Maybe we can think of ways to separate and specialize badgeholders more broadly, such as development, education, etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I know others have already said this, but I would also like to see more info on applications. VCs are one of the things. Additionally, I would like that the unjustified absence of certain relevant information (such as VC investments) to be a criteria for disqualification of the project.</p>\n<p>Not everyone will want to be transparent, but this needs to be penalized.</p>\n<p>In the next round, perhaps there could be some form of reporting throughout the round, as well as a way for badgeholders to be aware of the report (much information was placed in the badgeholders group, but it easily gets lost there).</p>\n<p>Also, as some others have suggested here in the forum, for the next round, it might be interesting to think about a token lock mechanism for the application of a project/individual.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rounds separated by category</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It was quite challenging in this round, at least personally, to put projects with million-dollar investments on an equal level with projects without any funds. Individual applications were even more difficult.</p>\n<p>The expected impact is totally different for an infrastructure project, and analyzing all at once certainly hinders the assessment of allocations.</p>\n<p><strong>That\u2019s it folks</strong>! Always remembering that RPGF is an experiment, everything I say is aimed at making things even better for the next round.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all the fellow badgeholders who voted for their effort and dedication, and to everyone at the Foundation who conducted this round, it was an incredible experience.</p>", "post_number": 118, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2023-12-26T01:03:11.900Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 15, "reads": 94, "readers_count": 93, "score": 288.8, "yours": false, "topic_id": 6177, "topic_slug": "retropgf-round-3-feedback-thread", "display_username": "Jo\u00e3o Kury", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "flair_group_id": null, "version": 2, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "link_counts": [{"url": "https://gov.optimism.io/t/join-the-retropgf-projects-showcase/6979", "internal": true, "reflection": false, "title": "Join the RetroPGF Projects Showcase!", "clicks": 3}], "read": true, "user_title": "", "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 13}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 10465, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 2, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": false}, "subpath": ["31678"], "author": "JoaoKury", "creation_time": "2023-12-12T19:05:55.874000+00:00", "content": "<p>Hello everyone, I\u2019ve been reading some great feedback here and would like to share my perspective as well.</p>\n<p>For context, this was my first round as a badgeholder, and it was also the first time a project I\u2019m involved in participated in RPGF.

On one hand, this is positive because many applications were processed, but on the other hand, it\u2019s not fair to the projects not to provide a coherent justification for the flag. Another project I\u2019m part of was rejected, and I still don\u2019t exactly understand the reason for it (Optimism Portugues).</p>\n<p>I also believe allowing only 2-3 days for projects to appeal through a google form may not be the best option. Why not use the governance forum?</p>\n<p>Moreover, I still believe that the quorum of 17 for a project to be \u201cqualified\u201d is not a good idea. In the last 2-3 days, several projects and individuals tried to contact me, essentially begging to add the project to my ballot so they could reach 17. <strong>I think this is not positive for the project, badgeholders, or the Collective.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set realistic expectations for badgeholders</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The application said that \u201cacting as a voter in RetroPGF 3 requires a minimum time commitment of 5-10 hours.\u201d I know it said \u201cminimum\u201d, but the time was much longer than that.</p>\n<p>As mentioned by others, to do minimally acceptable work in this round, many hours of work were necessary, and 643 projects were at stake. There was no way to finish the work in 10 hours, especially if the badgeholder participated in pre-voting meetings.</p>\n<p>It would be better to align these expectations before the Round starts for badgeholders to better plan their votes.</p>\n<p>Also, the rule \u201cDo not DM badgeholders\u201d should be taken <strong>more seriously</strong>. As long as we let it continue the rule will continue to be broken. Certainly, part of this arises from the need for smaller projects to promote themselves to reach the minimum quorum of 17. But can\u2019t we create other forms of promotion/contact for these projects? <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/join-the-retropgf-projects-showcase/6979\">Proof of Integrity</a> conducted more than 7 initiatives for projects to present themselves; Why not do this on a larger scale?</p>\n<p>Another important point is that it is almost impossible to analyze all projects. We need to be more focused and assign people who know about the subject to evaluate it. For example, it\u2019s not useful for someone who doesn\u2019t know about development to evaluate development projects. Maybe we can think of ways to separate and specialize badgeholders more broadly, such as development, education, etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I know others have already said this, but I would also like to see more info on applications. VCs are one of the things. Additionally, I would like that the unjustified absence of certain relevant information (such as VC investments) to be a criteria for disqualification of the project.</p>\n<p>Not everyone will want to be transparent, but this needs to be penalized.</p>\n<p>In the next round, perhaps there could be some form of reporting throughout the round, as well as a way for badgeholders to be aware of the report (much information was placed in the badgeholders group, but it easily gets lost there).</p>\n<p>Also, as some others have suggested here in the forum, for the next round, it might be interesting to think about a token lock mechanism for the application of a project/individual.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rounds separated by category</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It was quite challenging in this round, at least personally, to put projects with million-dollar investments on an equal level with projects without any funds. Individual applications were even more difficult.</p>\n<p>The expected impact is totally different for an infrastructure project, and analyzing all at once certainly hinders the assessment of allocations.</p>\n<p><strong>That\u2019s it folks</strong>! Always remembering that RPGF is an experiment, everything I say is aimed at making things even better for the next round.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all the fellow badgeholders who voted for their effort and dedication, and to everyone at the Foundation who conducted this round, it was an incredible experience.</p>"}}

The detailed questions aligned well with project\u2019s objectives and allowed to effectively communicate impact. Future rounds could benefit from even more guidance/examples to assist applicants in showcasing their projects effectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lists and Collaboration</strong>: The concept of Lists appears promising for encouraging collaboration among badgeholders (as I believe it helped some projects to reach the quorum). It would be interesting to see how this tool could be adapted/utilized to support applicants in understanding badgeholder perspectives and expectations better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Clarity in Impact Evaluation</strong>: The emphasis on quantifying impact = profit was a good point and should be maintained imo. It provided with a clearer framework to present project\u2019s contributions. However, would note that it was kinda disappointing that it wasn\u2019t the main point of discussion during the RPGF3 discussions (e.g on Twitter).

That being said, VC funded projects do deserve recognition and perhaps even some rpgf funding.

It\u2019s like comparing Orange with Banana.</p>\n<p>Each category must have its own metrics, metrics published relatively before round application starts.</p>\n<p><strong>5] Round <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span></strong><br>\nMost likely Round 4 will see an increase by a factor 2 of projects, some will just apply to grab a slice of the cake (i have noticed few during Round 3 already) and they will get some.</p>\n<p>The flywheel is great, but i think we need to strive for a higer quality review of applications. To achieve this, we need MUCH MORE means to do it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More badge holders with variety of domains already involved in the crypto space</li>\n<li>Training of badge holders</li>\n<li>Badge Holders Committee per project category</li>\n<li>OP Project allocation per project category based on priorities voted the year before by Token Holders maybe?<br>\nFinally, some conclusion thoughts.<br>\nWhile VC funding must be disclosed and could impact votes, PMF &amp; project revenue should not. We should embrace projects success so that they continue investing this money into our ecosystem, otherwise they will be elsewhere.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some thoughts and hope the process will continue iterating &amp; improving.<br>\nHappy to discuss this if some have some questions.<br>\nSubli</p>"}}

Popularity Bias &amp; Nepotism</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"the-problem-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#the-problem-2\"></a>The Problem</h2>\n<p>Smaller, less connected projects get overlooked in the vast sea of applications, making it hard for them to gain the visibility they deserve, while well-known projects get relatively over rewarded. Also, we are a relatively small community and people want to make sure they vote for their friends; it is all natural and needs to be designed for.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-is-needed-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-is-needed-3\"></a>What is Needed</h2>\n<p>A method to ensure smaller less connected projects are noticed and evaluated fairly against more well known projects.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"possible-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#possible-solution-4\"></a>Possible Solution</h2>\n<p>Require badgeholders to review <strong>categories</strong> as opposed to single projects. If a badgeholder wants to review a specific project, they must review the entire category the project is in (categories should be small, e.g. 15-25 projects). A category-based voting system enables badgeholders to focus on their areas of expertise and interest, while effectively delegating votes in categories beyond their expertise to fellow badgeholders. This strategy not only aids in project discovery but it also breaks the voting up into more digestible chunks to improve badgeholders\u2019 ability to focus on deep diving into just a few projects. Consequently, each project will be more likely to receive a fairer evaluation based on its relative impact vs other projects in the same category doing similar work.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-2-lack-of-feedback-from-badgeholders-to-projects-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#h-2-lack-of-feedback-from-badgeholders-to-projects-5\"></a>2. Lack of Feedback from Badgeholders to Projects</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"the-problem-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#the-problem-6\"></a>The Problem</h2>\n<p>Badgeholders are not given an easy way to share honest feedback to projects about the WHY behind their vote. Projects could take this feedback and improve their projects, but there is no space designated for this in the voting process.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-is-needed-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-is-needed-7\"></a>What is Needed</h2>\n<p>A way to encourage open and honest feedback without fear of public backlash.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"possible-solution-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#possible-solution-8\"></a>Possible Solution</h2>\n<p>We should provide space for badgeholders to provide anonymous feedback during the voting process, badgeholders can give candid opinions and valuable insights on projects without concern for public opinion, enhancing the quality and integrity of the feedback. Given the availability and power of LLMs, we could easily have badgeholders write comments, have an LLM rephrase it, and standardize the tone/writing style and then submit the feedback in an anonymous way.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-3-quantifying-every-projects-impact-as-an-op-amount-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#h-3-quantifying-every-projects-impact-as-an-op-amount-9\"></a>3. Quantifying Every Projects Impact as an OP Amount</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"the-problem-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#the-problem-10\"></a>The Problem</h2>\n<p>Badgeholders in round 3 faced a very complex decision when evaluating projects: \u201cHow much OP is this project\u2019s impact worth?\u201d Quantifying qualitative impact is an impossible task, which, while manageable, is not a necessity to include in the design for voting in RetroPGF. Looking at the results, it seems a lot of badge holders simply gave out round numbers to a lot of projects as opposed to giving more detailed scores.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-is-needed-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-is-needed-11\"></a>What is Needed</h2>\n<p>We need a qualitative voting mechanism that can enable a badgeholder to give a stronger signal than \u201cThese 9 projects get 250k OP, these 41 projects all get 100k OP and these 54 projects all get 50k OP\u201d (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h6hPbRE5w8iJxVhxOSYvkMYz-HC6-lePOegXw-usW5Q/edit#gid=583271201\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">real median results</a>). We would also need a different manner of coming up with the OP amount that a project gets.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"possible-solution-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#possible-solution-12\"></a>Possible Solution</h2>\n<p>It is much easier to rank projects than to allocate OP amounts.

If a badgeholder wants to review a specific project, they must review the entire category the project is in (categories should be small, e.g. 15-25 projects). A category-based voting system enables badgeholders to focus on their areas of expertise and interest, while effectively delegating votes in categories beyond their expertise to fellow badgeholders. This strategy not only aids in project discovery but it also breaks the voting up into more digestible chunks to improve badgeholders\u2019 ability to focus on deep diving into just a few projects. Consequently, each project will be more likely to receive a fairer evaluation based on its relative impact vs other projects in the same category doing similar work.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-2-lack-of-feedback-from-badgeholders-to-projects-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#h-2-lack-of-feedback-from-badgeholders-to-projects-5\"></a>2.

They are providing public goods that anyone can use, but only 150 people actually looking at them</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-is-needed-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-is-needed-15\"></a>What is Needed</h2>\n<p>Turn RetroPGF into, not just a request for funding, but also a program that increases the communities awareness of the work that was done.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"possible-solution-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#possible-solution-16\"></a>Possible Solution</h2>\n<p>Quadratic funding is not just a way for projects to collect money, it\u2019s also a way for projects to get discovered by the wider community that is donating, it would be great if RetroPGF could work like this as well. Broadening the participation to encompass a wider range of voters beyond badgeholders would not only bring in a more diverse perspective but would also, lead to many voters discovering new public goods that can make their experience in Optimism better!</p>\n<p>I discovered soooo many interesting projects voting in RetroPGF, some of them I now use on a weekly/monthly basis. If we allowed more people to vote in RetroPGF we would reduce the impact of nepotism, encourage more people to apply so they can market their projects, and strengthen the second order network effects of the whole process.</p>\n<p>I would consider giving delegates and projects a voice in the results, maybe for example Badgeholders have 65% of the vote, delegates get 20% and projects get 15% of the vote.</p>\n<p>Public Goods are for everyone to enjoy. We should seize any opportunity possible to promote these projects.</p>"}}

Hence, it\u2019s unreasonable to expect them to somehow manage living expenses while they\u2019re building their projects, especially with their grants subjected to market volatility for a year. This situation deters high-quality developers and channels them towards marketing-heavy projects, which may offer a more immediate means of compensation because thats how they eat.</p>\n<p>Grant programs should prioritize long-term alignment rather than bounties. At present, we\u2019ve swung to the extreme end of the spectrum, where developers are compelled to hold onto their tokens without any actual compensation. This either forces them to focus on other paying jobs and contribute only in their spare time, or to seek grants from networks/platforms that offer upfront payment, resulting in a reduced pool of quality developers and making the grants non competitive simply because of the arbitrary limits and restrictions not actual resource limits.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, we don\u2019t need to eliminate token locks to address this issue. We could allow locked tokens to be wrapped, permitting grant recipients to open loans or credit lines with third-party lenders or market makers, using their locked tokens as collateral or even keep them unwrapped and just make it clear that practices involving private entities between each other based on these locked assets are not banned and parties are free to engage in any activities they wish with their assets, as long as they respect the lock. This way, they\u2019d remain aligned with the project\u2019s success, since they\u2019d want their locked tokens\u2019 value to increase. They\u2019d have funds from the loan to cover their living expenses and would face two options: default on the loan and act in a mercenary-like manner or increase the value of their collateral, repay the loan upon token unlock, and ultimately make a profit.</p>\n<p>I genuinely want to ensure this idea isn\u2019t specifically prohibited or viewed negatively, as it might influence future relationships or be grounds for revoking grants. I fully understand that the grant\u2019s intent is governance, not compensation, but I believe the foundation\u2019s liability ends at allocation. How people utilize their allocated assets would be their choice. I\u2019m just curious if the foundation or community sees it as inappropriate or against the program\u2019s spirit for grant recipients to independently engage with third parties in these arrangements, provided it\u2019s not explicitly disallowed.</p>\n<p>There doesn\u2019t seem to be explicit limitations preventing such use. There\u2019s a specific mention for growth grants regarding sales, but others only mention locks. Locked tokens aren\u2019t synonymous with no sale or no abstraction. I understand the spirit of locks aligns with governance but financial abstraction may or may not be an intent of the lock, and this proposition actually reduces the likelihood of tokens being sold within a year if they are able to have credit lines through third parties.</p>\n<p>I believe there\u2019s significant value in standardizing and accepting these practices, particularly in attracting more talented developers and fostering more proposals.</p>\n<p>By the way, I believe the one-year lock is not solely for legal reasons. The concern here may be securities law, but awarding tokens through grants inherently attributes some value to them in exchange for work. The duration of a lock doesn\u2019t change an asset\u2019s nature, and I\u2019m unaware of any case law suggesting otherwise. There\u2019s no strong legal basis for selecting the one-year duration. While it might offer some defense around tokens not being used as compensation, giving them away immediately upon reaching milestones is no different than locking them for a year. If the tokens were purely for governance and voting, it would be perfectly acceptable for them to be unlocked immediately for proposal voting. There would be no risk or reason to lock them so the only reason to lock them for 1y would be on the assumption they have financial value otherwise thered be no purpose for the lock.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m open to changing my opinions if anyone can provide case law, legal justification, or an explicit rule that relates to non-growth grants.</p>\n<p>To clarify, I wouldn\u2019t raise this issue if I didn\u2019t think it could greatly benefit the ecosystem. Another consideration might be with the purchase of put options upon the one-year expiration and unlock, serving as a hedge for the locked tokens. However, I\u2019m unsure if this would also be considered against the spirit of the grant, which is why I\u2019m advocating for open discussion.</p>", "post_number": 10, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2023-07-07T08:03:11.721Z", "reply_count": 1, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 3, "reads": 116, "readers_count": 115, "score": 118.2, "yours": false, "topic_id": 6303, "topic_slug": "season-4-feedback-thread", "display_username": "", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "flair_group_id": null, "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "link_counts": [{"url": "https://gov.optimism.io/t/we-need-to-talk-about-undisclosed-financial-interests/6424/5", "internal": true, "reflection": true, "title": "We need to talk about undisclosed financial interests", "clicks": 0}], "read": true, "user_title": "", "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 5}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 4022, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 2, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": false}, "subpath": ["27862"], "author": "Pr0", "creation_time": "2023-07-07T08:03:11.721000+00:00", "content": "<p>Posting this here, ran it through GPT 4 to make it more understandable and clean than the Discord discussion but I think its a pretty core consideration that needs to be addressed by the foundation for actual growth and getting quality devs and proposals.</p>\n<p>I firmly believe that the primary limitation for quality proposals is the token lock, particularly considering it applies to the entire allocation.

This either forces them to focus on other paying jobs and contribute only in their spare time, or to seek grants from networks/platforms that offer upfront payment, resulting in a reduced pool of quality developers and making the grants non competitive simply because of the arbitrary limits and restrictions not actual resource limits.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, we don\u2019t need to eliminate token locks to address this issue. We could allow locked tokens to be wrapped, permitting grant recipients to open loans or credit lines with third-party lenders or market makers, using their locked tokens as collateral or even keep them unwrapped and just make it clear that practices involving private entities between each other based on these locked assets are not banned and parties are free to engage in any activities they wish with their assets, as long as they respect the lock. This way, they\u2019d remain aligned with the project\u2019s success, since they\u2019d want their locked tokens\u2019 value to increase. They\u2019d have funds from the loan to cover their living expenses and would face two options: default on the loan and act in a mercenary-like manner or increase the value of their collateral, repay the loan upon token unlock, and ultimately make a profit.</p>\n<p>I genuinely want to ensure this idea isn\u2019t specifically prohibited or viewed negatively, as it might influence future relationships or be grounds for revoking grants. I fully understand that the grant\u2019s intent is governance, not compensation, but I believe the foundation\u2019s liability ends at allocation. How people utilize their allocated assets would be their choice. I\u2019m just curious if the foundation or community sees it as inappropriate or against the program\u2019s spirit for grant recipients to independently engage with third parties in these arrangements, provided it\u2019s not explicitly disallowed.</p>\n<p>There doesn\u2019t seem to be explicit limitations preventing such use. There\u2019s a specific mention for growth grants regarding sales, but others only mention locks. Locked tokens aren\u2019t synonymous with no sale or no abstraction. I understand the spirit of locks aligns with governance but financial abstraction may or may not be an intent of the lock, and this proposition actually reduces the likelihood of tokens being sold within a year if they are able to have credit lines through third parties.</p>\n<p>I believe there\u2019s significant value in standardizing and accepting these practices, particularly in attracting more talented developers and fostering more proposals.</p>\n<p>By the way, I believe the one-year lock is not solely for legal reasons. The concern here may be securities law, but awarding tokens through grants inherently attributes some value to them in exchange for work. The duration of a lock doesn\u2019t change an asset\u2019s nature, and I\u2019m unaware of any case law suggesting otherwise. There\u2019s no strong legal basis for selecting the one-year duration. While it might offer some defense around tokens not being used as compensation, giving them away immediately upon reaching milestones is no different than locking them for a year. If the tokens were purely for governance and voting, it would be perfectly acceptable for them to be unlocked immediately for proposal voting. There would be no risk or reason to lock them so the only reason to lock them for 1y would be on the assumption they have financial value otherwise thered be no purpose for the lock.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m open to changing my opinions if anyone can provide case law, legal justification, or an explicit rule that relates to non-growth grants.</p>\n<p>To clarify, I wouldn\u2019t raise this issue if I didn\u2019t think it could greatly benefit the ecosystem. Another consideration might be with the purchase of put options upon the one-year expiration and unlock, serving as a hedge for the locked tokens. However, I\u2019m unsure if this would also be considered against the spirit of the grant, which is why I\u2019m advocating for open discussion.</p>"}}

Honestly, this is a huge risk on my part, but it\u2019s ok, I\u2019m an Optimist. I want all of my teams to work with Optimism. Also I do believe in the long term value of the OP token and am hoping to work with the community to add utility to the OP token, see my comments in <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-economic-co-design-of-gas-fees-for-the-op-stack/6117\">Economic Co-design of Gas Fees for the OP Stack</a> for more details on my thoughts here.</p>\n<p>As far as Espacio Cripto or HER LATAM alliances that Brichis supported\u2026 Yes, Brichis works for GM, but she is supporting these Latam projects on her own time, and is not being paid by GM to support them, nor does GM have any contracts or expectations in any way with those teams. GM also doesn\u2019t have any insight into the deals she has made with these orgs. I am sure, though, that Brichis\u2019 knowledge on the complicated grant program this quarter would be very helpful to any team. It was very difficult to navigate.</p>\n<p>I want to reiterate the independence and autonomy of each project within and around the Giveth Galaxy. The collaboration and support among these projects, including grant application support from General Magic, aim to foster a thriving ecosystem for public goods. My involvement as a founder is focused on advisory roles, and the leadership and decision-making lie with the individual projects. Transparency and open dialogue are essential, and I am available for further discussions to address any concerns or provide additional clarity.</p>\n<p><strong>I am trying to be overly transparent. If anything that I am doing is going against the rules in any way, I am happy to learn about it so I can support Optimism in a more acceptable way. I am VERY aligned with the Optimistic Vision, I have been working towards a similar vision since 2015 and I don\u2019t intend to stop anytime soon. Optimism has created the best system out there to support Public Goods and it is something I am excited to really support behind. All I want to do is help in any way I can.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you or anyone else wants to have a deeper understanding I am happy to arrange a call.</strong></p>"}}

For me, sybil is one of the biggest roadblocks for decentralized governance many projects seeking for, and it is dramatically difficult to remove them once too late (already claimed all tokens). Based on my observations, I saw that there is a large scale of sybil on Juno chain (on Cosmos) where someone knew the criteria and gamed it.

From what I have noticed, token airdrops most commonly get dumped 1-2 weeks after the airdrop itself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Airdropping a token during a bear market does somewhat incentivise users - even more - to sell the airdrop off to remain liquid.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Airdropping a token during a bull market may stunt the token price appreciation in the short term: while the rest of the altcoins are pumping, your token is getting dumped because it got airdropped.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But don\u2019t get me wrong, threading such a needle in airdrop timing is incredibly difficult. It does require a substantial amount of luck and faith in your community to hold the fundamental principles and values of the token close enough that they wouldn\u2019t paper hand them upon claim.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another thing that relates to token prices after an airdrop is the airdrop size. We all want big airdrops, because that means big money. But, reducing the size of the airdrop does make the user think twice about selling right of the bat.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yet another needle to thread: the balance between an airdrop proportion fair enough to keep people happy, and an airdrop proportion insignificant enough that people won\u2019t sell</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead of granting lump-sums of airdrops in 1-4 phases, maybe stretch it out a bit more to about 5-10? <em>Not sure what the broader community feels about this, would like to hear some thoughts on this.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lastly, expanding token use cases in DeFi. This will help reduce sellers in the short term, while providing more options and usability of the token in the long-run. For example, hardly any protocols have a farm for single-staking $OP - many community members including myself are keeping an eye out for the \u201cbig-names\u201d of DeFi to implement this, such as Aave for example.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This was a problem which some DAOs <em>(I shall not name them)</em> that I participated in have. Expanding use cases of the token (e.g. more dApp implementation) will incentivise airdrop receivers to utilise their airdropped tokens in helping grow the Optimism ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have made some points on token price as I hate to see the community feel down after watching their tokens fall in price. As much we\u2019re all in here for the tech and values, we must remind ourselves to keep our heads up during downturns. If we can\u2019t do it ourselves, then better tokenomics must be implemented to help us. Moral and narratives matter more in crypto than anywhere else, we must remain optimistic.</p>\n<p>I would like to end this by saying, thanks for the great work Optimism - we\u2019re all looking forward for future advancements and developments.</p>", "post_number": 259, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2022-08-15T07:52:33.157Z", "reply_count": 2, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 6, "reads": 53, "readers_count": 52, "score": 65.6, "yours": false, "topic_id": 80, "topic_slug": "airdrop-1-feedback-thread", "display_username": "Dippudo", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "flair_group_id": null, "version": 2, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": true, "user_title": "", "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 1}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 4553, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": false}, "subpath": ["11780"], "author": "dippudo", "creation_time": "2022-08-14T02:18:01.528000+00:00", "content": "<p><strong>Airdrop <span class=\"hashtag\">#1</span></strong> was, without a doubt, a great success - congrats to the team.

From what I have noticed, token airdrops most commonly get dumped 1-2 weeks after the airdrop itself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Airdropping a token during a bear market does somewhat incentivise users - even more - to sell the airdrop off to remain liquid.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Airdropping a token during a bull market may stunt the token price appreciation in the short term: while the rest of the altcoins are pumping, your token is getting dumped because it got airdropped.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But don\u2019t get me wrong, threading such a needle in airdrop timing is incredibly difficult. It does require a substantial amount of luck and faith in your community to hold the fundamental principles and values of the token close enough that they wouldn\u2019t paper hand them upon claim.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another thing that relates to token prices after an airdrop is the airdrop size. We all want big airdrops, because that means big money. But, reducing the size of the airdrop does make the user think twice about selling right of the bat.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yet another needle to thread: the balance between an airdrop proportion fair enough to keep people happy, and an airdrop proportion insignificant enough that people won\u2019t sell</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead of granting lump-sums of airdrops in 1-4 phases, maybe stretch it out a bit more to about 5-10? <em>Not sure what the broader community feels about this, would like to hear some thoughts on this.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lastly, expanding token use cases in DeFi. This will help reduce sellers in the short term, while providing more options and usability of the token in the long-run. For example, hardly any protocols have a farm for single-staking $OP - many community members including myself are keeping an eye out for the \u201cbig-names\u201d of DeFi to implement this, such as Aave for example.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This was a problem which some DAOs <em>(I shall not name them)</em> that I participated in have. Expanding use cases of the token (e.g. more dApp implementation) will incentivise airdrop receivers to utilise their airdropped tokens in helping grow the Optimism ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have made some points on token price as I hate to see the community feel down after watching their tokens fall in price. As much we\u2019re all in here for the tech and values, we must remind ourselves to keep our heads up during downturns. If we can\u2019t do it ourselves, then better tokenomics must be implemented to help us. Moral and narratives matter more in crypto than anywhere else, we must remain optimistic.</p>\n<p>I would like to end this by saying, thanks for the great work Optimism - we\u2019re all looking forward for future advancements and developments.</p>"}}

But use platform like Clique could be a thing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>About the good behaviors that contribute to the community I think you still have to take into account the on-chain data. The number of quests made, the number of transactions over the year, the governance votes\u2026 The goal is to have a wide enough range of eligibility criteria to reward users properly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I think that making an airdrop too small in terms of amount is not a good thing in the long run. The idea is not to make only airdrop like season 1 but to find a middle ground.<br>\nMay be 2/3% of the supply per bach in order to keep it attractive.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}}

This would leave it up to the proposers to find the balance between impressive sounding KPI targets, with the risk of not meeting them, or to make more modest expectations on future performance which could mean their proposal is less enticing in the first place.</p>\n<p>TL:DR; basically exactly what you said, but a little less eloquently!</p>"}}

The committee\u2019s solution was more centralization and as far as I understand delegates are committee members, so much work for them. I think we need to facilitate the participation of new users.</p>"}}

I stuck around for Season 2 to monitor OP governance and learn about your experimental process. It\u2019s part of a larger scheme I\u2019m doing to research for our future governance model someday. I must commend everyone on their passion and dedication to Optimism.</p>\n<p>I will say that I have one major conclusion from Season 2: <strong>The Committee system, while well-intentioned, has been a huge net negative.</strong> I will explain my observations briefly below.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Committees make the application process confusing for all</strong><br>\n<img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/fceaf3fba092f78b33c4eb5b0c3c734d14259ebc.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"A5pHQjM1JYF9VU8SWeLnadtdYkI\" width=\"565\" height=\"129\"></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think I need to offer much-supporting evidence here. Almost every project has been confused by the committee system. The deadlines, allocations, and pretty much everything has been unclear. While I respect the idea that \u201cwe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d I  think it\u2019s far too confusing for the average applicant. Many of these projects are simultaneously doing a dozen other governance proposals, and forcing them through a complex committee process isn\u2019t efficient.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Committees warp the free-market power structure of delegation</strong><br>\nOne of the cool things about DAOs to me is the free-market aspect of delegation. If I, SR, wanted to become a delegate, I would need to either acquire OP, or convince people to delegate OP to me. If a delegate wishes to have more governance power, they can use any number of strategies to work on that. The best delegates will be the most competitive for the delegated OP.  We have delegates that are private holders, DAO enthusiasts, project leads, VCs, and more. That\u2019s kinda how it should be IMO.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, committees create <em>bureaucrats</em>. Or, in layman\u2019s terms, they create gatekeepers with a disproportionate amount of power than they should have. These committee members become lightning rods for controversy and gatekeeping.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Committees have brought out the worst in people</strong><br>\nIssues <span class=\"hashtag\">#1</span> and <span class=\"hashtag\">#2</span> both invariably lead to issue <span class=\"hashtag\">#3</span>, that the committee system has brought out accusations, corruption, innuendo, favoritism, Machiavellianism, brinkmanship, factions, and pretty much everything that poisons the governance process.</p>\n<p>This process started during the heated election between the defi committees and never stopped.<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5c1a1995d05c91d5945e98c95576b419061c2e90.png\"

RDs are required to vote and to write WHY they voted on proposals. They are then paid based on their participation rates and the # of delegates they have. This incentivizes delegates to write up their feelings on issues and spend some time going through the proposals.

I stuck around for Season 2 to monitor OP governance and learn about your experimental process. It\u2019s part of a larger scheme I\u2019m doing to research for our future governance model someday. I must commend everyone on their passion and dedication to Optimism.</p>\n<p>I will say that I have one major conclusion from Season 2: <strong>The Committee system, while well-intentioned, has been a huge net negative.</strong> I will explain my observations briefly below.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Committees make the application process confusing for all</strong><br>\n<img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/f/fceaf3fba092f78b33c4eb5b0c3c734d14259ebc.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"A5pHQjM1JYF9VU8SWeLnadtdYkI\" width=\"565\" height=\"129\"></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think I need to offer much-supporting evidence here. Almost every project has been confused by the committee system. The deadlines, allocations, and pretty much everything has been unclear. While I respect the idea that \u201cwe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d I  think it\u2019s far too confusing for the average applicant. Many of these projects are simultaneously doing a dozen other governance proposals, and forcing them through a complex committee process isn\u2019t efficient.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Committees warp the free-market power structure of delegation</strong><br>\nOne of the cool things about DAOs to me is the free-market aspect of delegation. If I, SR, wanted to become a delegate, I would need to either acquire OP, or convince people to delegate OP to me. If a delegate wishes to have more governance power, they can use any number of strategies to work on that. The best delegates will be the most competitive for the delegated OP.  We have delegates that are private holders, DAO enthusiasts, project leads, VCs, and more. That\u2019s kinda how it should be IMO.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, committees create <em>bureaucrats</em>. Or, in layman\u2019s terms, they create gatekeepers with a disproportionate amount of power than they should have. These committee members become lightning rods for controversy and gatekeeping.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Committees have brought out the worst in people</strong><br>\nIssues <span class=\"hashtag\">#1</span> and <span class=\"hashtag\">#2</span> both invariably lead to issue <span class=\"hashtag\">#3</span>, that the committee system has brought out accusations, corruption, innuendo, favoritism, Machiavellianism, brinkmanship, factions, and pretty much everything that poisons the governance process.</p>\n<p>This process started during the heated election between the defi committees and never stopped.<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5c1a1995d05c91d5945e98c95576b419061c2e90.png\"

If you miss a vote, your participation percentage goes down. If you miss a response, your response percentage goes down. If people undelegate, your voting weight goes down. All these things will determine how much you are paid.</p>\n<p>RDs avoid gaming the system by internal policing. Responses are not screened for being fair or balanced etc, they are simply screened for being cohesive and understandable, If someone is just copy pasting a canned response, that can be evaluated by the OP labs foundation.</p>\n<p>It would be wise for OPLabs foundation to create a sort of \u201cOmbudsman\u201d type role, that validated users\u2019 responses as adequate and kept the delegates in check to their status.</p>\n<p>There has been some concern expressed by delegate that they don\u2019t have the time/bandwith/allocations to do this work. <strong>But I would strongly discourage tolerating that behavior.</strong> In a delegate free market, if you don\u2019t vote and participate, you should generally lose delegation, and you certainly shouldn\u2019t be paid. Paying RDs gives smaller delegates a chance to snatch OP from bigger ones by being more thorough.</p>"}}

A lot of other crypto companies have had these issues and there have been a number of solutions. The biggest problem as I see it, is that OP is a layer 2, and the coin we use to do everything is ETH. This leaves us with limited us cases for the OP coin, and thus people just hold the coin in their wallet and forget about it. For this reason, we need to institute measures that increase token velocity of OP, as well bring in more community engagement. For these needs and circumstances I propose the following actions:</p>\n<p>Institute real yield staking- At first the staking can be inflationary, then maybe transition into a combination of inflation and real yield rewards, and then eventually all the revenue provided to stakers is from money generated from real yield. This would give the token a dividend that would make it a useful asset to hold, but will also make it useful in all sort of DEFI applications. Staking will also take supply off the market. 6 month lock up\u2019s are a smart idea as well. I think a good example of this would be GMX\u2019s staking portal.</p>\n<p>Another option is an algorythmic stable coin backed by the OP token. A good example of this could be SNX\u2019s SUSD. The stable coin could be seperate or part of the main staking.</p>\n<p>You attach a launchpad for OP stakers- basically stakers get airdrops and IDO\u2019s of new tokens that launch on OP.  ATOM and CARDANO are good examples of this.</p>\n<p>Exclusive NFT\u2019s that can only be bought with OP. Maybe burn OP in the process.</p>\n<p>Finally, governance is hard.

A lot of other crypto companies have had these issues and there have been a number of solutions. The biggest problem as I see it, is that OP is a layer 2, and the coin we use to do everything is ETH. This leaves us with limited us cases for the OP coin, and thus people just hold the coin in their wallet and forget about it. For this reason, we need to institute measures that increase token velocity of OP, as well bring in more community engagement. For these needs and circumstances I propose the following actions:</p>\n<p>Institute real yield staking- At first the staking can be inflationary, then maybe transition into a combination of inflation and real yield rewards, and then eventually all the revenue provided to stakers is from money generated from real yield. This would give the token a dividend that would make it a useful asset to hold, but will also make it useful in all sort of DEFI applications. Staking will also take supply off the market. 6 month lock up\u2019s are a smart idea as well. I think a good example of this would be GMX\u2019s staking portal.</p>\n<p>Another option is an algorythmic stable coin backed by the OP token. A good example of this could be SNX\u2019s SUSD. The stable coin could be seperate or part of the main staking.</p>\n<p>You attach a launchpad for OP stakers- basically stakers get airdrops and IDO\u2019s of new tokens that launch on OP.  ATOM and CARDANO are good examples of this.</p>\n<p>Exclusive NFT\u2019s that can only be bought with OP. Maybe burn OP in the process.</p>\n<p>Finally, governance is hard. I think it is more efficient to copy SNX\u2019s goverance model. In this model, stakers elect a council and the council is paid, and the council makes all the decisions. This allows the stakers to elect specialists that can become knowledgable in issues and make the best decisions when voting.
