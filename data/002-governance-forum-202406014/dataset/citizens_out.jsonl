Participants will work in a combination of plenary and subgroup settings across 2 sessions:\n<ol>\n<li>Thursday, May 30 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time (12:30-14:00 Eastern // 9:30-11:00 Pacific)</li>\n<li>Thursday, June 6 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time (12:30-14:00 Eastern // 9:30-11:00 Pacific)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Between the two sessions, the community will be able to comment on the draft output of the deliberation. Also, the plenary moments of the sessions will be opened to the full set of voters in Round 4. This allows for the broader community to better understand and trust the decision-making process. The full Citizens\u2019 House will ratify the output of the deliberative process before Round 4 voting begins.</li>\n<li>The ratified outcome will be incorporated directly into the Retro Funding 4 voting mechanism.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"next-steps-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#next-steps-5\"></a>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>In 2024, you can expect to see a more scientific and interdisciplinary approach to research and experimentation in the Collective (thanks to our new Research and Experiments Lead, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/elizaoak\">@elizaoak</a>.) We\u2019re excited to begin by testing a hypothesis that originated from a community member on the forums, and to experiment with an approach that empowers voters to address contested topics without interference from the Foundation.</p>\n<p>The Foundation will share additional details on the specifics of the deliberation on the forum before reaching out to the 50 randomly selected Round 4 voters via email.</p>"}}
