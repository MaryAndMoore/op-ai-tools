This non-standardized approach sparked [various debates](https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-role-of-vc-funding-in-retropgf/7342) within the community about whether external funding (e.g., VC funding, Optimism grants, or external grants) should be deducted from a project\u2019s overall public goods funding reward.\n\n### Round 4 Definition \n\nIn [Retro Funding 4: Onchain Builders](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988/3), a definition of profit will be universally applied to the retro round. Badgeholders will no longer need to calculate profit, but instead, a collective definition will be applied and subtracted from each voter\u2019s assessment of impact as such:\n\n>  ***Impact - Past transfers = Award in OP***\n\nThe possible categories considered as Past Transfers are: \n- Grants from Optimism\n- VC funding \n- Grants from other ecosystems \n- Revenue. \n\nAll data collected on this categories in the Round 4 application process was for the timeframe of Jan 2023 - May 23rd, 2024.\n\n--- \n\n### Deliberative Process \n\nOver the past month, a randomly selected subset of badgeholders [experimented with a deliberative process](https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-deliberative-processes-in-the-collective/8041) to determine this profit definition for Round 4.

Two votes occurred during the deliberative process experiment. The first was on which categories to include in the profit definition. The results can be found in the original link on the Optimism Forum:\n\n\nBased on the Collective's standard 51% approval threshold, these results determined that a **deduction weight would only be applied only to Optimism Grants.** \n\n#### Session 2 Vote\nThe second vote was on the deduction weight that should be applied to Optimism Grants, as broken into three sub-categories: \n- Token House growth grants, which are passed on to end users\n- Token House builders grants, which are locked for one year\n- Foundation grants and Missions\n- *Past Retro Funding is not included as the evaluation period begins after the end of Round 3\nThe responses resulted in a proposed profit definition of Round 4 as outlined in the original link on the Optimism Forum: \n\n\n\n\n\n### Ratification \n\nIf you wish to ratify the below definition, which will be globally and automatically applied to the voting result calculation in Round 4, please vote \u201cYes\u201d on this proposal. \n\n>   **Impact - ((10% * Token House Growth Grants) + (45% * Token House Builders Grants) + (25% * Foundation Grants)) = Award in OP**\n\nIf you do not wish to ratify this definition, a fallback definition proposed by the Foundation will be globally and automatically applied to the voting result calculation in Round 4 instead. This definition is: \n\n> **Impact = Award in OP**\n\nThe deliberative process experiment surfaced the amount of complexity, nuance, and effort required to accurately define profit and the challenges in verifying self-reported profit data which is oftentimes not publicly disclosed. In light of these learnings, the Foundation believes it is premature to accurately calculate profit and instead proposes solely focusing on impact in Round 4. The fallback profit definition below, will be implemented if this proposal is not ratified.\n\nIf you don\u2019t agree with the profit definition but still ratify it because you prefer it to the Foundation\u2019s proposed alternative, please explain your rationale under the proposal draft on the forum.\n\n**Quorum will require 30% of badgeholders to cast a vote with an approval threshold will be 51% of votes cast.**", "discussion": "https://gov.optimism.io/t/ratification-of-profit-definition-for-round-4/8312", "quorum": 0, "quorum_type": "default", "snapshot": "20120885", "scores": [20, 34], "winning_option": "No, don't consider profit at all"}
