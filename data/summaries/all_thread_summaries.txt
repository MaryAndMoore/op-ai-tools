<about>
This thread provides an analysis of the impact of $OP rewards on Pika Protocol, focusing on various metrics to determine the effectiveness of the incentives.
</about>

<overview>
- Background: Pika Protocol received 900,000 $OP tokens in August 2022 to drive adoption.
- Metrics analyzed: Total value locked (TVL), trading volume, fee revenue, number of trades, and number of active traders.
- TVL: Increased from $1m to $9m in one month, peaking at $15m in June 2023, but dropped to $5m in July 2023.
- Trading volume: Peaked at $165m in January 2023, dropped significantly after the Optimism #2 airdrop snapshot in January 2023.
- Fee revenue: Correlated with trading volume, peaking at $128k in January 2023, then decreasing to $30k in August 2023.
- Number of trades: Peaked at 435k in January 2023, dropped 99% after the airdrop snapshot.
- Number of active traders: Peaked at 110k in January 2023, declined significantly after the airdrop snapshot.
- Conclusion: $OP incentives had a positive impact initially, but many users were motivated by the airdrop rather than the platform itself.

<about>
The discussion is about the idea of airdropping OP tokens to Ethereum validators, specifically those who have deposited into the Beacon Chain Contract. The conversation explores the potential benefits and challenges of including or excluding different types of stakers, such as solo stakers, staking services, and centralized exchanges.
</about>

<first_post>
- Good idea but problematic if staking services also get airdrops
- Suggests a fixed amount for anyone running validators, regardless of number
</first_post>

<reaction>
- General agreement on excluding exchanges and Lido for decentralization
- Some suggest a decay or penalty for Lido if not excluded
- Emphasis on rewarding solo stakers and those maintaining resources
- Consideration of including RocketPool and Gnosis chain validators
- Discussion on incentivizing decentralized staking and future node operation for Optimism
- Debate on whether liquid staking token holders (stETH, rETH) should be included
- Consensus on targeting unique individual node operators, not the number of validators
- Suggestions to redistribute tokens from sybil farmers to validators
- Acknowledgment of the complexity and edge cases in implementation
