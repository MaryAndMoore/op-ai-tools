Question,Answer,Elapsed Time,Context
Are there any specific KYC requirements for grant recipients in the Optimism community?,"Based on the information provided, there are some KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements that grant recipients need to fulfill in order to receive grants from the Optimism Foundation, but the details are not fully specified. Here are the relevant points I could gather:

1. Multiple posts mention that grant recipients will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation in order to receive the grant, but the exact requirements are not spelled out.

2. One post states: ""To comply with laws and regulations, Optimism's processes require that we KYC all grant recipients.""

3. Another post has someone saying: ""I've received multiple answers to this, none of them end-all be-all clear on what is required. We want to be flexible but ultimately if our entire multisig has to KYC it's probably a no go.""

4. There is an email address provided for KYC questions related to grants: govgrants@optimism.io

So in summary, while it is clear that some level of KYC is required for grant recipients from the Optimism Foundation, the exact requirements do not seem to be publicly specified and may vary case-by-case. The best way to get clarity would be to reach out to the govgrants@optimism.io email for more details on the KYC process for a specific grant proposal.",15.443830013275146,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'ARCHIVED  & OLD Missions', 'thread_title': '[DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Curve', 'creation_time': '2023-07-10T11:35:10.338000+00:00', 'username': 'system', 'moderator': True, 'admin': True, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '63.3089.27963'}, page_content='<blockquote>\n<p>While the Optimism Foundation typically does not publicly discuss details of individual or project grant recipients, we wanted to provide some context for the community members looking for more transparency around the Curve grant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To comply with laws and regulations, Optimism’s processes require that we KYC all grant recipients.

Part of of the grant is to subsidize your RPC endpoints (34% for example), while another paid by developers (33%), and the rest 33% you can offer as co-incentives.

We will reward donations on Optimism to verified projects and we will launch an incentivized staking and locking system called GIVpower. Both of these systems will be rewarded in GIV, streamed over time on Optimism, which will bring users back to the Optimism chain again and again to claim their rewards until the GIVstream ends on December 23rd, 2026.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?:</strong></p>\n<p>We have been around since 2016 and aren’t going anywhere. Our current version of the donation application rewards donors in a similar way as tax deductions, but without the borders or bureaucracy. Donors are rewarded when they donate to any verified project anywhere in the world. They aren’t rewarded with paperwork though, they are rewarded with $GIV. This is a web3 improvement on the subsidy model for nonprofits that has been used around the world with great success.</p>\n<p>$GIV’s token model is very similar to veCRV, except the locked tokens determine the donation mining rewards instead of liquidity mining rewards.</p>\n<p>Regen instead of Degen.</p>\n<p>But our mission is much larger than the current state of the GIVeconomy. Our goal is to enable nonprofits to create their own economies that can reward them for their work.</p>\n<p>We believe nonprofits create value, and that economies can be created around that value. If this theory is true, we will succeed, as we are further along this path than anyone else.</p>\n<p>Our very close partner, Commons Stack, helped deploy a nonprofit microeconomy called the Token Engineering Commons, which has only donated to projects supporting the Token Engineering space. It has had no other token utility other than governance over it’s small pot of funds and yet their token price has actually beat the price of ether!</p>\n<p>When the TEC was launched in 2021, ether was $3300 and TEC was $1. As of time of writing, nearly 2 years later, ether is down ~50% and TEC is only down ~30%. This is very encouraging. Commons Stack has learned a lot from the TEC and has improved the design pattern and is now partnering with ReFi DAO to continue this applied research by deploying many more of these microeconomics. This research will end up being used to build a path for projects on Giveth to follow so they can also launch their own microeconomies.</p>\n<p>This long term vision is well outlined here: <a href=""https://medium.com/giveth/evolving-nonprofits-into-regen-economies-f8282f97f8d3"" class=""inline-onebox"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Evolving Nonprofits into Regen Economies | by Griff Green | Giveth</a></p>\n<p><strong>How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate:</strong></p>\n<p>Since 2021 on our current iteration of the Giveth DApp (excluding the previsions iterations) we have had more than 2,300 projects created, and over 1,400 of those have been verified by our team to be legitimate public goods projects.</p>\n<p>We have had over 15,000 donations (obtained from our development team) from 4,500 unique donors for over $1.6 mil.

Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism:</strong></p>\n<p>With this grant we will build out the Giveth ecosystem on Optimism. There are no donation platforms on Optimism as far as I know. This use case is completely missing, and for a project focused around public goods, we believe there will be a lot of users willing to donate, more on average than most chains. Giveth’s system will lock them into the Optimism ecosystem for the next several years.</p>\n<p>We will:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Enable projects to collect donations on Optimism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enable Optimism users to donate ANY token in the Optimism network to their favorite nonprofits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reward donors to verified projects on Optimism with GIVbacks streamed for the next several years on Optimism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Allow GIV holders on Optimism to stake and lock their tokens in GIVpower for governance rights to boost projects. Boosted projects show up higher on our home page and give more GIVbacks to their donors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reward GIVpower users that have staked and locked their GIV will earn a yield in GIV streamed for the next several years on Optimism .</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our rewards programs are sticky. When a donor donates to a verified project, or when someone stakes GIV, they get some liquid GIV and a GIVstream that will stream GIV to them until Dec 2026.</p>\n<p>This means, any donor or staker on Optimism will be coming back to the Optimism network to collect their GIV for the next several years. Giveth has been active in the Ethereum community since 2016 and isn’t going anywhere, our token is more likely to have value for the next several years than most teams that apply to this grant process IMO.</p>\n<p>This grant will be used to provide long term liquidity for GIV to keep users on the chain for the next several years.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.:</strong></p>\n<p>We are targeting nonprofits, public goods projects, Refi projects, impact DAOs and crypto donors of all kinds. More specifically:</p>\n<p><strong>Nonprofits</strong>: Any organizations in the non-profit space regardless of the regional scope and legal status. We aim to target it with partnerships with organizations already working with many of these actors.</p>\n<p><strong>Public goods projects</strong>: Any project working for public goods, including community projects, activists and all efforts intending to provide public goods. This is the broader target. We aim to target it with partnerships with organizations already working with many of these actors.</p>\n<p><strong>ReFi projects &amp; Impact DAOs</strong>: Web3 native projects focused on making a positive impact. These projects are growing exponentially. In a very niche space where Giveth is well-positioned to capture.</p>\n<p><strong>Crypto Donors</strong>: Basically anyone who has crypto and isn’t a 100% full on degen. This is a large market, which depends on the world situation. For instance, the war in Ukraine and the earthquakes in Turkey &amp; Syria turned many Ukrainian and Turkish crypto users into donors, even if they didn’t probably didn’t consider themselves donors before those events.</p>\n<p>Over $50 million was raised by Ukraine projects in crypto and over $6 million for Turkey and Syria so far.</p>\n<aside class=""onebox allowlistedgeneric"" data-onebox-src=""https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-donations-provide-fast-relief-for-turkey-syria-earthquake-victims/"">\n  <header class=""source"">\n      <img src=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/c/c2f7f151afaa2839dff9ceac1d6f6bef042fa088.png"" class=""site-icon"" data-dominant-color=""FF5300"" width=""16"" height=""16"">\n\n      <a href=""https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-donations-provide-fast-relief-for-turkey-syria-earthquake-victims/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"" title=""05:56PM - 21 February 2023"">Chainalysis – 21 Feb 23</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=""onebox-body"">\n    <div class=""aspect-image"" style=""--aspect-ratio:690/387;""><img src=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/c/cc894c523b70cd94e2d38616946efe20bfda858e_2_690x388.jpeg"" class=""thumbnail"" data-dominant-color=""88686A"" width=""690"" height=""388""></div>\n\n<h3><a href=""https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-donations-provide-fast-relief-for-turkey-syria-earthquake-victims/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Crypto Donations Provide Fast Relief for Earthquake Victims in Turkey and...</a></h3>\n\n  <p>""Cryptocurrency has been a major factor in helping people in humanitarian crises, as it has brought millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine.

(250k OP max):</strong></p>\n<p>40k $OP</p>\n<p><strong>How do you justify the size of the grant?:</strong></p>\n<p>16k $OP would be rewarded to the first 640 verified public good projects on Giveth that add an $OP donation address. This is important to bootstrap the network effect of Optimism on our platform</p>\n<p>24K $OP will be given out as a milestone based on usage and will be used to create an LP against GIV to allow GIV to have a secondary market on Optimism. Giveth will use its own GIV and pair it with the OP to make a 50/50 liquidity pool on the best dex as advised by the Optimism Grants committee (probably Velodrome if we can get GIV whitelisted).</p>\n<p>This is much less than the original request as we intend to use some of the OP that we received from RPGF round 2 to create our own LP.</p>\n<p>To allow GIV to be given to donors on Optimism, we would need to have a liquid market on Optimism, otherwise we would be driving people off the chain. This is why we’d want to build our way up to a sizable LP with Optimism. This OP will not be sold, it will simply be held in an LP for perpetuity. We would be very happy to hold it in a multisig with other members of the optimism community so that Giveth doesn’t have control over it if that is deemed necessary.</p>\n<p>In my honest opinion, this is much better than liquidity mining. We can do that though. We can create an OP/GIV farm on Optimism and “rent” the liquidity, but Sushiswap APRs for OP/ETH is &gt;80% so for a OP/GIV pool, I would expect it to find a balance at ~150%. This would mean around 100k OP would get us $400k of liquidity for &lt;6 months (assuming the price stays stable).</p>\n<p>We can do that and I will outline some cool ways to do so in comments below in the next few days as an alternative, but we truly believe a token swap approach is much more beneficial for the Optimism ecosystem, so that is what we have included in this proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=""roadmap-and-distribution-plan-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#roadmap-and-distribution-plan-3""></a>Roadmap and Distribution Plan</h2>\n<p><strong>Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan.

Can I refer to OP token grants in terms of their USD value?,"No, you should not refer to OP token grants in terms of their USD value. According to the Optimism documentation on important terms:

""The OP token is a governance token and should be discussed as such. Use ""OP"" instead of ""$OP."" The use of the $ is prohibited in connection with ""OP."" Token grants are made in OP - they are allocations of governance authority, not cash - and they should not be converted to USD, nor referred to in USD amounts.""

The reason is that the OP token represents governance rights and voting power within the Optimism ecosystem, not an investment asset or cash value. Discussing OP token amounts in USD terms could encourage speculative behavior around the token price, which goes against Optimism's principles of focusing the token on its governance utility.

So when referring to OP token grants or amounts, you should simply state the number of OP tokens, without converting to a USD value. The key is to frame OP tokens as governance resources, not tradable assets with a fluctuating price.",11.976660013198853,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'ARCHIVED  & OLD Missions', 'thread_title': '[REVIEW][GF: Phase 1 Proposal V2] Prime Rating', 'creation_time': '2022-09-23T05:48:22.152000+00:00', 'username': 'Bobbay_StableLab', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '63.3216.13597'}, page_content='<ol>\n<li>Could you expand on your partnership with DeFi safety (more out of curiosity and the type of support they provide in technical reviews)?</li>\n<li>What are the levels and increases in $OP token rewards?</li>\n<li>Could you provide a more detailed breakdown of how you got the grant size? $215k seems like a hefty amount.</li>\n<li>What operational efforts will be covered in the 10%?

I am amswering below in the order of your comments/questions:</p>\n<p>Overnight is VC funded, we have not issued the OVN token yet as it would limit our VC funding options. We also very much believe that the product should make sense without rewards (which USD+ has demonstrated), then rewards can be used temporarily to promote and scale it. We are graduating from Berkley’s Xcelerator around 2nd of Novemeber and will then take the decision about the OVN-token public sale, which is likely to take place at the end of November.</p>\n<p>USD+ is not a USDC wrapper, it is a stablecoin that’s 100% collaterized by yield-generating strategies, made of the best quality stables deposited in high-quality protocols (mostly, not lending pools). USD+ magic power is its ability to generate yield in liquidity pools, e.g. inside Velodrome, thus making liquidity mining way more capital efficient. In a traditional pool you get fees and rewards, in a pool with USD+ you get fees, rewards and yield by USD+. USD+ is a rebase token, so we indeed provide a wrapper over USD+ that some people use for tax purposes, and is used by some protocols for integration purposes (e.g. wrapper is used inside Balancer’s boosted pools) )</p>\n<p>We need to work better with DeFIama, as the numbers you mention are obviously wrong. The metrics on Optimism alone largely exceed what you mention and as of this morning are:<br>\n(a) TVL - 4.36M for USD+, 4,47M total<br>\n(b) Total number of active users - 287 for USD+, 307 total</p>\n<p>Overall TVL 8.1M, total active users (hard to exclude duplicates) - roughly 3200, discord community 4,06K. It is a little weird that OP is now our largest chain… what has happened is that once we launched, our power users from Polygon and BNB have moved, in some cases completely, to Optimism - due to much more attractive performance and rates (see below). we have cannibalised at least 3M of our TVL from other chains</p>\n<p>As far as trading volumes are concerned, in crypto-pairs USD+ is able to achieve same trading volumes as USDC. For example, wMatic/USD+ on polygon generates same trading volume as wMatic/USDC (as % of TVL).

Can Optimism currently censor user transactions?,"Based on the information provided, it seems that currently Optimism does have the ability to censor transactions or make other changes to the network since it is still centralized and controlled by the Optimism Foundation and its multi-sig.

A few key points from the documents:

1. polynya raises concerns that since Optimism is essentially like a centralized exchange (CEX) currently, authorities could force Optimism to censor users, freeze funds, or make other unwanted changes since the Optimism Foundation maintains control through its multi-sig.

2. polynya suggests Optimism should move towards more decentralization and transparency, such as using timelocks and an emergency council like zkSync, rather than the non-transparent multi-sig controlled by the Foundation.

3. bobby from the Optimism team acknowledges that currently Citizenship and governance is limited, but the long-term goal is for Citizens to represent the will of the users once Optimism becomes more decentralized.

So in summary, yes currently the centralized control by the Optimism Foundation means they do have the ability to censor transactions or make other changes, which is a risk until Optimism becomes more decentralized and moves control to the users/Citizens through robust governance. The team seems to recognize this limitation and has decentralization as a goal.",14.40758490562439,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Governance  Design 📐', 'thread_title': 'Proposal to pause Governance Fund voting cycles till minimum viable decentralization is achieved', 'creation_time': '2022-08-09T17:52:03.562000+00:00', 'username': 'polynya', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '84.3215.11650'}, page_content='<aside class=""quote no-group"" data-username=""lefterisjp"" data-post=""18"" data-topic=""3215"">\n<div class=""title"">\n<div class=""quote-controls""></div>\n<img loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""24"" height=""24"" src=""https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/lefterisjp/48/9240_2.png"" class=""avatar""> lefterisjp:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now for the question on whether to halt funding any grants until decentralization is achieved I am not sure I understand the connection there.

But consider that Optimism is basically like a CEX currently and comes with all of the same risks:</p>\n<p>a) Due to negligence (malice I think is very unlikely), Optimism’s multi-sig is compromised, and the malicious entity executes an upgrade that could be as bad as draining all funds in the bridge.<br>\nb) Hackers only need to target Optimism Foundation and its founders, employees etc. Or worse still, kidnappers looking for a steep ransom or whatever.<br>\nc) US Treasury or some authority wants to sanction an app or a user on Optimism for whatever criminal activity. If it’s an immutable contract ala Tornado Cash, their best method of attack is to simply sanction members of Optimism - who as far as I know are US citizens. Now, the details of their multi-sig is very much obscured, and I also don’t know about which jurisdiction(s) Optimism Foundation comes under. But the fact that there’s no transparency about any of this is a big problem.<br>\nd) Alternatively, an authority can force Optimism to censor certain users or dapps, enforce an irregular state transition, freeze funds - Optimism can do any of that, really, while Optimism Foundation maintains an emergency backdoor.</p>\n<p>Now, the bigger the TVL, the more the economic activity, Optimism becomes a signficantly bigger target. While its TVL is &lt;$1B, it’s OK as a beta product. But as we go past $2B, and with more incentives flowing out unthrottled, it could be $5B, and it could end up being the biggest target after Ethereum itself. Ethereum is very difficult to attack, but Optimism - you just need to compromise their multi-sig.</p>\n<p>Of course, some may say all of this is dramatic and unrealistic, which is why I didn’t want to go into more details. But my answer is simple - Ethereum was designed to be maximally robust, decentralized and secure, that could survive under the most extreme of black swans.

Can projects that have already received a grant apply for more funding?,"Based on the information provided, it seems that projects that have already received a grant from Optimism can potentially apply for additional funding, but it will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Specifically, one of the fragments mentions:

""Do you mean projects which have already received grants through an Optimism Governance proposal? Usually such projects won't necessarily need the financial support anymore but we are happy to still support them on other fronts, e.g. provide technical support to them. We don't want to make a hard cut-off rule here though but would rather look at them on a case by case basis.""

This suggests that while projects that already received a grant may not automatically qualify for more financial grants, their applications can still be considered depending on the circumstances and potential impact. Non-financial support like technical assistance is also mentioned as a possibility.

However, it's not explicitly stated whether previously funded projects can reapply for Collective Grants (upfront grants) or just Retroactive Public Goods Funding rewards. The criteria and process may differ between the two grant types.

So in summary - previously funded projects can potentially get additional support, but it will likely depend on factors like the type of previous grant, the proposed new work, alignment with Optimism's goals, and evaluation by the relevant governance bodies.

Can the length of the challenge period be changed?,"Based on the information provided, I could not find any specific details about changing the length of the challenge period for proposals in the Optimism governance process.

However, the Optimism governance process and associated timelines seem to be documented and followed carefully. Any potential changes to key aspects like the challenge period length would likely require a formal governance proposal to be submitted, discussed and approved by the relevant governance bodies.

The process for submitting and considering governance proposals appears to be outlined in the documentation linked in one of the excerpts:

""This is what you need to do, read through this doc and understand the complete process: https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/proposals/""

Without being able to review that full documentation, I cannot provide specifics on if/how the challenge period duration could be modified. But it does seem like substantive process changes would need to go through the established on-chain governance mechanisms, rather than being unilaterally changed. My recommendation would be to review the latest governance process documentation for details on proposing and approving process changes like adjusting the challenge period timeline.",11.814584016799927,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Technical  Proposals 📃', 'thread_title': 'Solution to improve DAO governance process', 'creation_time': '2023-12-21T03:15:38.371000+00:00', 'username': 'como', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 0, 'id': '47.7272.31804'}, page_content='<p><strong>1. Motivation:</strong></p>\n<p>I believe Optimism is very serious about the its Governance Process and involving community in making key decisions as evidently by the amount of work has go into this document (<a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/welcome-to-the-optimism-collective-discourse/7"">Optimism Governance Process</a>)</p>\n<p>I’m a co-founder of Syncvote. I believe our tool can add tangible value to the implementation of Optimism’s governance process without any changes to the current setup. The goal is to let admins and members focus on making decisions instead of getting lost in tech stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Problem Now:</strong></p>\n<p>I see 3 existing problems in implementing Optimism governance process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The proposer must remember all the technical details of the governance process to avoid making mistakes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The proposer has to bounce around different platforms, such as Discord, Forum,… for each step of the process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any solution that could potentially consolidate everything into one platform for consistency and ease of navigation would require the DAO to abandon its current setup and adopt a new one.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>3.How We Solve It:</strong></p>\n<p>Syncvote provides a chrome extension. It works as a unified front-end for any DAO member that wants to make a proposal to Optimism. It acts like a central hub, no more bouncing between different platforms. Members can kick off and handle proposals, watch progress, and move through stages – all in one interface.</p>\n<p>Why Syncvote will fit nicely into the current Optimism practice:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Non-invasive, there isn’t any new platform to familiarize with, just open the extension and click “start new proposal” to start.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The extension works with all the platforms DAO has been using, so you don’t need to make any changes to your current setup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s free, our goal is to eventually put every DAO to operate completely on-chain, so until Optimism decides to write data on-chain; it won’t cost you anything.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My co-founder’s created this video to illustrate how the plugin works for a DAO: <a href=""https://www.loom.com/share/5f18dbdaa1a942298a24d1a82fa738a8"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Syncvote Demo</a></p>\n<p><strong>4. Next Steps to Implement:</strong></p>\n<p>To implement this transformative solution for Optimism we propose the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>After the proposal has been passed, I will convert the Governance Process into a format compatible with Syncvote. An administrator/coreteam member can help me to follow-up and also check its accuracy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After that, Optimism will start announcing to community members on forum, announcement channels on discord and twitter… that they can start using Syncvote extension to make new proposals from then on.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In conclusion, I see this as a straightforward implementation that helps to smooth governance experience for Optimism community members.

Do I need to claim my tokens for Airdrop #2?,"No, you do not need to claim your tokens for Optimism's Airdrop #2. According to the information provided, Airdrop #2 tokens are being sent directly to eligible wallets without any need to claim them.

Specifically, this excerpt states clearly that no claiming is required:

""Airdrop #2 does not need to be claimed. Airdrop #2 is distributed directly to eligible wallets. There is no need to claim tokens by interacting with any website. Do not trust any website pretending to help you claim your tokens for Airdrop #2. If an address is eligible, it will have tokens sent directly to it on February 9th, 2023 by 8pm ET.""

So if your wallet address was eligible based on the criteria of having delegated OP tokens for governance and/or spending gas fees on Optimism, then the Airdrop #2 tokens should have been sent directly to your wallet without you needing to take any action to claim them. You just need to check your wallet to see if the tokens have arrived.

Do I need to hold a minimum amount of tokens to submit a proposal?,"No, you do not need to hold any OP tokens to submit a governance proposal for the Optimism Collective. According to the Operating Manual, anyone can submit a proposal, as long as it is one of the valid proposal types listed.

The key requirements are:

1) The proposal must fall under one of the valid proposal types, such as Governance Fund allocations, Protocol Upgrades, Inflation Adjustments, etc.

2) The proposal goes through the 3-week review and voting cycle process outlined in the Operating Manual, including getting approval from 2 delegates with >0.5% voting power to move to an on-chain vote.

3) For the proposal to pass, it needs to meet the specified quorum and approval thresholds for that proposal type when voted on by OP token holders/delegates.

So in summary, no minimum OP token holding is required to submit a proposal initially. The community review and delegate approval filters determine which proposals proceed to an actual vote by OP holders. This allows anyone to contribute ideas to the governance process.",12.658233165740967,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Delegates  🏛', 'thread_title': 'Operating Manual of the Optimism Collective (v0.2.0)', 'creation_time': '2022-08-25T20:48:41.858000+00:00', 'username': 'lavande', 'moderator': True, 'admin': True, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '41.3370.12230'}, page_content='<p>This document describes the current governance proposal process of the Optimism Collective.

""Participants commit to the Law of Chains independently. No party acquires the ability to bind the other by virtue of their shared commitment to these guidelines. The Law of Chains does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship among anyone.""

It is not a legal contract, and provides no legally enforceable warranties, representations, indemnities, rights, or obligations.  Participants commit to the Law of Chains independently.  No party acquires the ability to bind the other by virtue of their shared commitment to these guidelines.  \n:::  \nThe Law of Chains is intended to provide guidance to ecosystem participants.  It does not establish any legally enforceable rights or obligations.  Its contents do not have the effect of law and are not meant to legally bind the public or any person in any way.  \nFor example, the Law of Chains presents a concept of “Participant Protections.”  This framing is intended to reflect elevated importance; a matter of principle. But Participant Protections are not, and do not create, legal rights, or corresponding legal obligations. They are not absolutely guaranteed to any ecosystem participant.  \nIf Participant Protections are violated, one may appeal to Optimism Governance.  This is like saying: “one may appeal to the democratic process.”  Optimism Governance is not a legal entity or a singular adjudicative body.  It is a collection of many unaffiliated, independent, and uncoordinated individual voters.  Its outcomes cannot be guaranteed.  \nRelatedly, participants that subscribe to the Law of Chains do so independently, and they conduct themselves independently under it, bearing their own risks and rewards. No party acquires the ability to contractually bind the other by virtue of their shared commitment to these guidelines. The Law of Chains does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship among anyone.  \nThe Law of Chains is a set of guidelines.  It is not a contract.  If you need legally enforceable guarantees from specific people or entities, you need some kind of specific contract with them. This document, standing alone, is not that.

We think it might be worthwhile to distinguish two other groups that have a tremendous impact on the network and its’ dynamics - Superchain Builders and the OP Token Holders.</p>\n<p>Both groups have an existential interest in the Superchain future and might have interests/pain points that are not necessarily in line with the groups already mentioned. Not taking their perspective into account, and especially merging them all within one broad ‘Users’ group might result with misunderstandings. One such misunderstanding would be in the case of a conflict between asset holders and smart contract deployers.</p>\n<p>As stated in §7.a: <code>In the event there is a conflict between different Participant Protections, User Protections will supersede all other Participant Protections.</code><br>\nUsers are defined us <code>Any party that holds assets or transacts on an OP Chain or deploys a smart contract to an OP Chain is acting in their capacity as a User.</code></p>\n<p>So in a conflict between asset holders and smart contract deployers, who has the priority?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It might be useful to elaborate a bit on what “The Platform” is. Since the Law of Chains defines how we collectively manage the “Platform” it is crucial that everyone has a shared understanding, at least on a higher level, of what The Platform is.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An important distinction to be made is between what constitutes the common infrastructure managed and governed by the collective and what are the parameters that each Superchain member-chain governs independently on its own.</p>\n<p>If this has not yet been decided and is deliberately not specified in the Law of Chains, it would be worth stating this directly and mentioning the process that will lead to its clarification.</p>\n<ol start=""3"">\n<li>In §6, we read: <code>Survival: The Platform must be able to evolve in response to threats that pose a real, existential risk to the Platform as whole.</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We’re curious to know how is the Platform going to address this issue?</p>\n<p>In our opinion addressing this would require allocating some form resources since in order to evolve, the Platform needs a team or even multiple teams working on it and The Collective needs to be able to define the direction in which it wants the Platform to evolve (i.e. define the development road-map and ensure its execution).</p>\n<p>The other requirements mentioned in the ‘Platform as Commons’ section, sustainability and security, are already being addressed by the OP chains sharing the revenue, and by the Security Council. However, we don’t really understand how survival is going to be addressed in the future.</p>\n<ol start=""4"">\n<li>\n<p>In the current context of the Law of Chains, we are not sure about the exact meaning of Governance minimisation. While we agree with the overall approach of turning rules enforced only on the social layer into code-enforced mechanisms, we also think that it needs to be further specified.<br>\nWhat governance mechanisms, structures or processes do we envision in the future and how do we see the role of each of the governance participants within those are just some of the questions that immediately come to mind.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is also the question of how is the Law of Chains going to be maintained in the future?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is stated that <code>the Law of Chains will require adaptation to changing circumstances as the Collective defines itself, evolves, and grows iteratively over time</code>, but there is no mention of a process for these iterations to take place.</p>\n<p>The first version of Law of Chains has been drafted by the Foundation and will be ratified by the Collective, but how is it going to be worked it in the future? If we want the Optimism ecosystem to be sufficiently decentralised, then we shouldn’t just be voting on the changes but rather we should collectively be discussing the required adaptations. How will we ensure that all relevant stakeholders will participate and have a say in the discussion?</p>\n<ol start=""6"">\n<li>Lastly, the Law of Chains provides a structure for the rules of participation in the Superchain, but it does not currently define any process or rules regarding how will we onboard/offboard participants to the Superchain.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Right now this seems to be handled by the Foundation, as we saw with <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/welcoming-base-to-optimism-governance/6689"">the Base announcement</a>, but what would that process look like in the future? In the “Future Of Optimism Governance” blog post, it is mentioned that <code>This meta-governance power marks the end of the Foundation’s stewardship of the evolution of Collective governance and entrusts the governance community with continued experimentation towards a healthy end-state for Optimism.</code></p>\n<p>It is our understanding that the Foundation’s role as a steward of The Collective will come to an end at some point in the future. When that happens, who will be responsible for onboarding and offboarding participants to the Superchain?</p>\n<p>In our opinion The Law of Chains is a good step towards a better future of decentralized management of Superchain, but now it needs a lot of discussion about its clarification.

How are Mission Requests ranked and funded in the Optimism Governance system?,"In the Optimism governance system, Mission Requests are ranked and funded through an approval ranking voting process by delegates. Here are the key points:

1. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives that delegates want to see built to achieve the Intents (high-level goals) for a given governance season.

2. Delegates vote to approve or not approve each Mission Request using approval ranking. They can vote ""yes"" with their full voting power on as many Mission Requests as they want.

3. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of ""yes"" votes, which is 51% of the 30% quorum threshold.

4. The top ranked Mission Requests that meet the minimum ""yes"" vote threshold are accepted in rank order until the allocated budget for that Intent is fully utilized.

5. If accepting a Mission Request would push the Intent's budget over the approved amount, that Request and all lower ranked ones are not funded.

6. The approved Mission Requests are then opened up for teams to apply for grants to fulfill those Missions. The Grants Council evaluates applicants and awards grants.

7. Any Intent budget amounts left over after funding the approved Missions are returned to the Governance Fund.

Teams can apply for a grant to fulfill a Mission Request and the Grants Council evaluates which applicants will receive grants.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>In Season 6, Delegates will be asked to approve Mission Requests proposed by the Grants Council and the <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863"">Collective Feedback Commission</a>.</p>\n<p>Mission Requests will be proposed under each Intent in a suggested rank order. Delegates may either follow this suggested order, by voting down the line, or they may chose to override these suggestions and vote in their own preferred order. Below is an example of how ranking works.</p>\n<h3><a name=""how-does-approval-ranking-work-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#how-does-approval-ranking-work-3""></a>How Does Approval Ranking Work?</h3>\n<p>Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of “Yes” votes they receive. Approval ranking is a voting mechanism that allows each delegate to cast a vote with their full voting power, on as many options as desired.</p>\n<p>Each Mission proposal must receive a minimum number of “yes” votes, equal to 51% of the 30% quorum. Any Mission Request that does not receive &gt; required number of “yes” votes will not be approved.</p>\n<p>The top ranked Mission Requests, above the minimum number of “yes” votes, will be accepted in rank order until the Intent Budget is fully allocated. If a Mission Request would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included and neither will any of the budget requests ranked beneath it.</p>\n<p>The main point of approval ranking is to prioritize work, not to optimize for complete allocation of the budget. Prioritization is a larger challenge for DAOs than fully allocating budgets as DAOs typically struggle to allocate budgets <em>sustainably</em>, allocating insufficient resources to core work and allocating too many resources to non-core work.</p>\n<p>Intent Budgets will be calculated based on the total amount of OP that could be allocated via the Request. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine the following scenario:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Votable supply = 20M OP</li>\n<li>Quorum = 6M OP (30% votable supply)</li>\n<li>Minimum yes vote requirement = 3.1M OP (51% of quorum)</li>\n<li>Total budget for Intent <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#10</span> = 200k OP</li>\n</ul>\n<p>–-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mission Request 1: Ask for 50k OP, 5M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 2: Ask for 50k OP, 2M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 3: Ask for 50k OP, 3.4M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 4: Ask for 75k OP, 3.3M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 5: Ask for 35k OP, 3.2M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 6: Ask for 25k OP, 3.1M OP votes (all are Yes votes.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Mission Request 1, 3, and 4 would move forward, as they were all above quorum and within the 200k OP budget. Mission Request 2 did not meet the quorum requirement. Mission Request 5 met quorum but was over the budget allocated to this Intent (including Mission Request 5 would have pushed the total to 210k OP rather than the approved 200k OP). Mission Request 6 wasn’t ranked high enough to qualify.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If an Intent Budget is over/underallocated, it should be viewed as an opportunity to assess several potential factors to improve future decision making, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether or not reasonable/appropriate budgets were proposed for each Intent</li>\n<li>Whether or not the Governance Fund is the optimal mechanism through which to support the initiatives proposed under each Intent</li>\n<li>Whether or not there were quality Mission Requests proposed under each Intent</li>\n<li>Whether or not any high impact initiatives did not move forward as a result of under/over allocation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=""how-should-delegates-think-about-casting-votes-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#how-should-delegates-think-about-casting-votes-4""></a><strong>How Should Delegates Think About Casting Votes?</strong></h3>\n<p>This vote utilizes approval ranking. You may place a vote to approve any number of Missions Requests you would like to approve with your full voting power. That means, in the above example, if I am a delegate with 1M OP voting power, I could cast votes as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mission Request 1: 1M OP (approve)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 2: Abstain (don’t approve)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 3: 1M OP (approve)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 4: Abstain (don’t approve)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 5: 1M OP (approve)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a voter, you should vote “Yes” on the Mission Requests you think most deserve to move forward, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think deserve to move forward. Delegates should not vote on their own proposals, including Mission Requests they have authored and/or sponsored.</p>\n<h4><a name=""when-evaluating-mission-requests-please-keep-in-mind-they-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#when-evaluating-mission-requests-please-keep-in-mind-they-5""></a>When evaluating Mission Requests, please keep in mind they:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>should describe a start-to-finish initiative, not ongoing services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>shouldn’t specify the team that should complete the Request</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>shouldn’t rely on any Foundation action or support   - should not propose metagovernance changes and/or structures (such as the creation of committees and/or Councils).

The concept of Intents and Missions struck me as quite inspiring; it undoubtedly steered our efforts in a clear direction.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I must mention that the overall process seemed quite convoluted. The path to comprehending the requirements and adhering to the deadlines often required navigating a maze of forum posts. Understanding the nuances between the Foundation Missions (RFPs), Proposed Missions (Intent 1, 3 and 4), and Intent 2: which includes Builders Grants, Growth Grants, and RFGs, proved to be somewhat elusive at times.</p>\n<p>Every category brought its unique set of procedures, rules, deadlines, and even communication platforms—spanning Github, Forum, Discord, Google Meets, and Charmverse. For individual developers or small teams, who may lack sufficient time or resources, this could be quite overwhelming. Upon reflection, I believe that <strong>a comparison chart</strong> could have offered significant utility. In general, a more streamlined arrangement of these elements could result in a more user-friendly experience. <strong>An interactive quiz to identify the best-suited funding path for each project</strong> could be a thoughtful addition.</p>\n<p>While I understand that this was an experimental venture, I see room fo<strong>r improving the promotional efforts.</strong> A newsletter or a Medium post to announce significant updates could enhance the reach and effectiveness of our communication.</p>\n<p>My commendation goes to the governance team and Grants Council for their unwavering commitment, patiently addressing every query. <strong>I enjoyed the Grants Council Office Hours, and would advocate for a similar approach for Proposed &amp; Foundation Missions.</strong></p>\n<p>The Optimism Alliance forming workshop was nothing short of excellent and certainly merits a rerun. Additionally, the idea of delegates hosting pitching sessions was appealing. However, there’s scope for enhancing delegate engagement. Throughout the calls, delegate participation was relatively sparse.</p>\n<p>The mission’s procedural framework, encompassing delegate approval to voting, functioned smoothly. Nevertheless, <strong>I would appreciate seeing more delegate involvement.</strong> <em>Could we potentially devise ways to spur their participation in such processes?</em> Of all individuals with more than 0.25% delegation, merely 10-15 delegates were present, some of whom were from the Grants Council, tasked with reviewing over a hundred projects—a number that’s destined to increase.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, it could be advantageous to have a <strong>dedicated person or team to shepherd projects throughout the entire process.</strong> This person or team should possess a comprehensive understanding of all funding avenues within Optimism and be able to tailor their advice to the specific needs of each project.</p>\n<p>We might consider <strong>showcasing successful examples</strong> as a way to set clear expectations for what we’re looking to achieve.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, being part of this experimental initiative was a genuinely enriching experience. My deepest congratulations to the governance team, Grants Council, and everyone else who contributed to making this initiative a success. <img src=""https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/raised_hands.png?v=12"" title="":raised_hands:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":raised_hands:"" loading=""lazy"" width=""20"" height=""20""></p>\n<p>Edit: Although I understand why, I would like to add that the one year lock-in is a big constraint for those who want to build in Optimism, I think we could have had less problems with the amounts in the budgets if there could have been an upfront payment.

How are the rubrics for reviewing Mission applications in Season 5 structured?,"Based on the information provided, the rubrics for reviewing Mission applications in Season 5 were structured as follows:

- There were separate rubrics created for each Intent (Growth Experiments and Builders sub-committees).

- The rubrics contained different categories/criteria that applications would be evaluated against. Some categories were marked as optional and could be removed if not applicable to a specific Mission Request.

- For the Growth Experiments intake review, applications could be declined if they met certain criteria such as the project not being deployed yet, being out of scope for incentivizing user growth, circumventing rules, being underdeveloped, etc. A second reviewer approval was needed if declining for those reasons.

- The draft rubrics for Season 5 were shared publicly in a ""Season 5, Rubrics Feedback Thread"" for the community to provide comments by March 25th, 2024. The rubrics were then finalized on March 28th, 2024 after incorporating feedback.

The rubrics were adapted for each Intent and sub-committee to ensure applications were thoroughly and fairly assessed against the specific criteria relevant to that Mission Request type.

Note that given the number of different mission requests (43) the Grants Council decided to create standard rubrics for each intent and each subcommittee and make edits based on the substance of the mission request.</p>\n<p>Categories marked as (optional) could be removed from a specific mission request if it does not apply to the specific mission request.</p>\n<p>The intake filter incorporated a few new points.<br>\nIntake review for Growth Experiments submission can be declined if:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The project is not deployed</li>\n<li>Out of scope: Not incentivizing user growth</li>\n<li>Circumventing the No Sale rule</li>\n<li>It’s a grant program within a grant</li>\n<li>Determination of OP recipient (end user) is not organic</li>\n<li>underdeveloped</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A second reviewer approval is needed if the intake is declined for any of these reasons.</p>\n<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14PCmw2VeXgKT7qyNTBL6cCWfHQMCW0nurMZnPjsH6XE/edit?usp=sharing""><strong>Link to draft rubrics</strong> </a></p>'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Grants  🏹', 'thread_title': 'Cycle 19: Final Grants Roundup', 'creation_time': '2024-03-22T00:20:30.504000+00:00', 'username': 'Gonna.eth', 'moderator': True, 'admin': False, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 3, 'id': '69.7850.35334'}, page_content='<p>All mission requests from Cycle 19 have been fully reviewed. The overwhelming interest in contributing to the Optimism ecosystem has been truly remarkable, with a total of 314 applications received for 28 mission requests.</p>\n<p>The reviewers evaluated each mission application, paying particular attention to the scope of the mission requests. Using the adapted rubric for each intent and subcommittee, assessments were made to ensure thoroughness and fairness. Looking ahead, we encourage authors to suggest additions to the standard rubric to further streamline the evaluation process. Your valuable feedback on rubrics for the upcoming round can be shared <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-rubrics-feedback-thread/7649"">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This cycle showcased the unwavering dedication of every member of the grants council, as evidenced by the record number of applications reviewed. Each Growth reviewer assessed an average of 100 applications, while each builder reviewer did an average of 150 submissions. Despite the increased workload and having one less reviewer from the original design (I had to take Grant Council Lead), the commitment of the builder’s subcommittee was impeccable, and the growth subcommittee provided vital support in evaluating hybrid mission requests (Locked and liquid OP within the same application).</p>\n<p>Special acknowledgment is due to the Charmverse team for their instrumental role in providing the necessary tools to facilitate the review process. Leveraging the rubric, workflow, and form tools for the first time, we achieved an impressive success rate of 97.2% out of 314 applications without errors and solved any issues on a 12-hour gap. Seamless communication between reviewers and applicants further enhanced the efficiency of the process, paving the way for the upcoming milestone hub implementation.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to the second round, <a href=""https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/application-guide-4494195094676161"">applications are now open</a>.

You may also reference the extensive report on the process created by Seed LatAm <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-participation-and-incentives-season-5-cycle-16-19/7852"">here</a>, which helped to inform the retrospective below.</p>\n<p>This retrospective has been used to inform the design of <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-missions-v2-5/8106"">Missions v2.5</a>. The primary learning from Season 5 Missions was the need to optimize the experience for builders. Many of the changes in v2.5 are aimed at optimizing the entire experience for builders, a key priority supporting <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents/8104"">Intent #3: Grow Application Devs on the Superchain</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of the stages below are no longer relevant in v2.5 but the retrospective may serve as reference to help the community better understand how we arrived at the v2.5 design. You can skip straight to the Season 6 process <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-missions-v2-5/8106"">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This retrospective is not exhaustive but summarizes many of the main pieces of feedback and analysis.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Drafting Mission Requests</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There were 74 Mission Request drafts in Season 5, relative to 49 Mission Proposal drafts in Season 4.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being the first time delegates were asked to draft Mission Requests, there was confusion over whether a Mission Request should specify the team to complete it, the ideal level of specificity, and what was meant by the term “baseline grant amount.” Delegates asked for clarification on whether a Mission Request could be submitted under multiple Intents, whether they could vote on their own Mission Requests, and whether Mission Requests could later receive Retro Funding, if eligible. Builders were confused about whether they were expected to create Mission Requests or apply to them. The drafting process required considerable time and effort from the top 100 delegates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-missions-v2-5/8106"">Missions v2.5</a> simplifies the drafting process by reducing the set of eligible delegates to members of the Grants Council and the <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863"">Collective Feedback Commission</a>. In practice, there is very little change as the set of eligible delegates proposed the majority of Mission Requests in Season 5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We believe this change will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improve the scoping of Mission Requests and prevent projects from writing Mission Requests tailored to their own products.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Simplify the process for all delegates, while still allowing any community member’s idea to be sponsored by eligible delegates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Abstract the drafting and approval process away from builders, which should streamline their experience. Builders shouldn’t have to interact with the Mission Request drafting process, they only need to understand the grant application process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Eliminate the need for delegate approvals, which when combined with the other changes, reduces the amount of downtime in our grants program by 3 weeks, which is important to applicants.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have clarified ambiguities in this process in the following guide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-mission-request-creation-guide/8123""><strong>Mission Request Creation Guide</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sponsoring Mission Requests (New in Season 5)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In Season 5, any top 100 delegate could draft a Mission Request. However, if you weren’t a top 100 delegate, you could ask one to sponsor your idea. Roughly half of Mission Requests that were allocated tokens were sponsored, indicating sponsorship serves a meaningful function.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sponsorship will continue in Season 6! In Season 6, only delegates that are part of the Grants Council or the Collective Feedback Commission will be able to draft Mission Requests. Given the value of sponsorship in Season 5, it is recommended that those delegates sponsor ideas suggested by other community members.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The number of delegates sponsoring community ideas is likely to remain consistent with Season 5, as only 24/100 delegates sponsored in Season 5. In Season 6, there will be ~ 40 eligible delegates able to sponsor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Notably, a majority of Mission Requests under Intent <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#1</span> and Intent <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#3</span> were made by external contributors that were sponsored, indicating delegates and/or the Governance Fund may not be the highest context party to support work under these Intents. In Season 6, Mission Requests will be rescoped to the Intents focused on governance contributions and ecosystem growth, and other mechanisms will be utilized to support core technical contributions, infrastructure, and developer tooling (see <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents/8104/2"">Season 6 Intents</a>.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Approving Mission Request Drafts</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The approval process is one method to provide a quality filter on proposals. It appears to be effective, as only 58% of Season 5 drafts proceeded to a vote, relative to 63% in Season 4.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A majority of delegate time and effort was spent providing approvals on drafts. While the below initiatives to make the approval process easier appear to have been effective, we don’t believe this complex process is the highest impact use of delegate attention.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Increasing the set of delegates that could provide approvals to top 100 delegates allowed more delegates to provide approvals. Notably, 30% of the delegates that provided approvals in Season 5 would not have been eligible to provide approvals in Season 4. However, the percentage of eligible delegates that participated remained flat season over season.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Foundation randomly sampled proposals to delegates that volunteered to provide approvals, which had a moderate participation rate but received positive feedback from participants.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The govNERDs were extremely helpful in promoting compliance with scope and templates and ensuring proposers received feedback and approvals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We extended the time period to provide approvals relative to Season 4 and the Grants Council was not occupied with other duties during this period, as in Season 4.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While approvals serve as an important quality filter for major proposals (like Protocol Upgrades), other means of quality filtering are necessary when there are many proposals to evaluate in the same cycle, as with Mission Requests. Constraining the set of delegates eligible to create proposals is another filtering mechanism, which is what most DAOs use (ie. minimum proposal thresholds.) We will experiment with this filtering method in Season 6.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The delegate approval process will be eliminated for Mission Requests in Season 6, reducing the workload on delegates and reducing downtime and confusion for grant applicants.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Voting on Mission Requests</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>63% of the Mission Requests that moved to a vote were approved (36% approval rate from original drafts). This compares to 87% in Season 4 (55% approval rate from original drafts).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Season 5 was the first Season in which rank ordering was relevant, under Intent <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#2</span> and Intent <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#3</span> only, as 10 proposals (~25%) received enough votes to meet quorum but weren’t allocated tokens as they would have been over the Intent allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Meanwhile, 25% of the Intent <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#1</span> allocation went unallocated while 60% of the Intent <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#4</span> allocation went unallocated. Underallocation can be indicative of many things including lack of ideas, over budgeting, and/or a mismatch between the Governance Fund and the type of work to be supported. In the case of Intent <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#1</span>, we believe the Governance Fund is not the best option to support this type of work given the stage of development of the OP Stack. A smaller allocation for Intent <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#4</span> (now under Intent <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#1</span>) seems appropriate based on demand over the past two Seasons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We received questions on the approval ranking voting mechanism and evaluated how provision of tokens would have changed using a mechanism that optimizes for maximum allocation rather than allocating tokens to only the highest priority initiatives. In short, there was a small portion of tokens unallocated due to the ranking mechanism. There was a larger portion of tokens unallocated due to lack of demand under Intent <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#1</span> and Intent <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#4</span>. There was ~2M OP requested that wasn’t provided due to prioritization (in other words, allocation would have been 25% higher had all Mission Requests been allocated tokens.) The mechanism appears to be working as intended, as prioritization is a larger challenge for DAOs than fully allocating resources. DAOs typically struggle to allocate resources <em>sustainably</em>,  under-resourcing core work and over-resourcing non-core work.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173.png"" data-download-href=""/uploads/short-url/q1I3wC0FZLG2kQE0J5z7YuGutmX.png?dl=1"" title=""image""><img src=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173_2_690x147.png"" alt=""image"" data-base62-sha1=""q1I3wC0FZLG2kQE0J5z7YuGutmX"" width=""690"" height=""147"" srcset=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173_2_690x147.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b66a065e4899d58645a8abb6f39eab87a95ec173.png 2x"" data-dominant-color=""ECEBE9""><div class=""meta""><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#far-image""></use></svg><span class=""filename"">image</span><span class=""informations"">984×210 23.5 KB</span><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#discourse-expand""></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We received feedback that one week was not long enough to assess all Mission Requests.

Some of these suggestions are included below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There was a lot confusion stemming from a misalignment in governance and grants calendars. Applicants should only need to reference one calendar in Season 6, and there should be no periods of overlapping deadlines. Start dates, deadlines, and decision dates will be made clear from the start of the Season.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We need to improve the discoverability of key application information, streamlining and simplifying communications on one platform and ensuring communications are consistent between the Foundation and the Grants Council.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The need for applicants to understand the difference between builders and growth grants should be eliminated as all applicants may now submit hybrid applications.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Selecting Mission Applications</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In the first grants cycle, 13% of all applications were approved.

How can I become a support NERD in the Optimism community?,"To become a support NERD (Nurturing Enthusiastic & Resourceful Discorder) in the Optimism community, you need to follow these steps:

1. Fill out the ""wannabe-NERD"" form to express your interest.

2. Be active in the Optimism Discord server for at least 2 months.

3. During those 2 months, actively offer support in the Discord by:
   - Answering questions you know the answers to
   - Tagging support-nerds for questions you can't answer
   - Reporting scams, bots or spam
   - Keeping the channels organized 
   - Directing users to post in the correct support channels
   - Answering questions in threads
   - If multilingual, helping in the language-specific channels

4. Read the descriptions of all channels and pinned messages to understand the server.

5. Read the user support docs and developer docs (if technical) and report any issues.

6. After meeting the requirements, post proof in the #wannabe-NERD channel. 

7. If approved, you'll get the nerd-in-training role for 2 more months of continued support.

8. An existing NERD will then nominate you to become a full support-NERD if your support was high quality.

9. The nomination gets voted on by other support-NERDs, needing a majority to be ratified.

How can I find out who my current delegate is and see their voting record?,"According to the Optimism documentation, you can identify your current delegate and view their voting record by following these steps:

1. Go to the link: https://help.optimism.io/hc/en-us/articles/6389519530779-How-do-I-see-how-my-delegate-voted-

2. This article provides instructions on how to see who your current delegate is and review their voting history on past proposals.

Specifically, it states that you can go to the Optimism Governance Portal at https://vote.optimism.io/ and connect your wallet. This will show you which delegate (if any) your OP tokens are currently delegated to.

Once you know your delegate's address, you can look up their voting record and rationale by:

- Checking their delegate communication thread on the Optimism Governance Forums
- Looking up their address on snapshot.org to see how they voted on past proposals
- Checking sites like https://optimism.showkarma.xyz/ which track delegate voting participation

So in summary, connect your wallet at vote.optimism.io to identify your delegate, then use that information to review their voting history and shared rationale across the governance platforms.

How can I get involved in the Optimism Collective?,"There are several ways you can get involved and contribute to the Optimism Collective:

1. Do what you love - Real impact stems from passion, so focus on areas that excite you. Identify problems you care about solving and propose solutions that could benefit the Optimism ecosystem.

2. Participate in governance - You can get involved in the governance process by becoming a Delegate or participating in the Citizens House. As a Delegate, you can vote on proposals and have a direct say in decision-making. The Citizens House allows you to discuss ideas and provide input.

3. Contribute technically - If you have a technical background, you can contribute to the open-source codebase, improve developer tooling, or work on infrastructure projects.

4. Apply for grants - The Optimism Collective funds public goods projects through grants. You can submit a grant application for an idea that aligns with the Collective's goals and intents.

5. Join community efforts - Participate in community events, educational initiatives, or awareness campaigns to help onboard new users and developers.

6. Provide feedback - Share your thoughts, suggestions, and feedback on the governance forum to help shape the direction of the Collective.

The key is to start small, focus on areas you're passionate about, and work collaboratively with others in the community. The README file recommends following the Collective Intents to ensure your contributions align with the larger goals. Additionally, you can check the ""Get a Grant"" page to see what types of projects are currently being sought.",13.996853828430176,"[Document(metadata={'path': 'contribute', 'document_name': 'README.md'}, page_content='---\ntitle: Contribute to Optimism\nlang: en-US\n---  \n::: tip Welcome!  \nSo you want to get involved in the Optimism Collective?? We are so happy to have you! Let’s make sure we are on the same page about what The Collective is all about.  \n:::  \nThe Optimism Collective believes that **building public goods should be rewarded.**  \nThis key ingredient to the [Optimistic vision](https://www.optimism.io/vision) is more than just altruism – it’s core to our success. Optimism’s codebase itself is an open-source project, and builds on the shoulders of countless OSS giants which came before it.  \nThis means public goods funding is a critical growth strategy. For Optimism, well-funded public goods means better developer tooling, widespread user education, safer infrastructure, and industry-leading research. It means Optimism can last and thrive.  \nOnce we show that this model can drive a successful economy for the Optimism Collective, we can scale the principle of **`impact = profit`** to the world!  \nRetroPGF is a core part of Optimism’s vision. If done right, it will form the backbone for a new type of economy. As with any complex system, though, this new process can’t be centrally planned or designed all at once. **The only way to build it *well* is to build it *together*.** This journey will require care, open-mindedness, patience, and, of course, optimism!  \nSo, how can you have meaningful impact in The Collective? We recommend following these 3 very easy principles:  \n1. ***Do what you love.*** → Real impact stems from passion, a love for what you do.\n2. ***Fix the problem in front of you, together.*** → Chances are if you have a problem, someone else has that problem as well. Let’s fix it together! What caused the problem? How do you fix it, and can we work together to fix it for everyone else?\n3. ***Do it with optimism.*** → Be kind, patient and optimistic in everything you do.  \nMost importantly, make sure that your contributions align with the [Collective Intents](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874). This will help ensure that your contribution is working towards a larger goal of the Collective.  \n# Getting Started  \nYou can contribute towards the collective in a million different ways, and there is no way we could make processes for all of these contributions.

My experience in driving awareness and understanding of blockchain projects will be invaluable in furthering the goals of the Optimism ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant:</strong> In my perspective, an exemplary Governance Fund grant should encapsulate key tenets. Efficiency is at its core, where judicious use of resources for maximal impact is essential. A well-charted strategy, clear vision, and alignment with Optimism’s broader objectives are crucial. Grants should be anchored with measurable outcomes and tangible milestones, ensuring meticulous progress monitoring. Key indicators of a stellar grant include a revolutionary product/use case for the protocol within Optimism and the overarching DeFi ecosystem, an evident trajectory to non-incentivized growth, definitive KPIs and milestones linked to token values, a stellar team across various domains, a robust Treasury safeguarding against OP token misuse, and an underlying strategy for protocol decentralization.</p>\n<p><strong>What types of Mission Requests do you think will help achieve the Season 5 Intents?</strong></p>\n<p>To truly achieve the Season 5 Intents, I believe our mission requests should encompass a multi-faceted approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Decentralization</strong>: At its core, blockchain and DeFi promise decentralization. Our mission requests should prioritize initiatives that further this principle, ensuring that Optimism remains a protocol “of the community, by the community, and for the community.”</li>\n<li><strong>Developer Onboarding</strong>: The lifeblood of any evolving tech ecosystem lies in its developer community. Efforts should be made to actively onboard new developers, offering them robust tools, educational resources, and incentives to innovate within the Optimism ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Awareness on Tokenomics</strong>: For genuine, widespread adoption and trust, the broader community needs clarity on Optimism’s tokenomics. Mission requests should target educational campaigns, workshops, or seminars that demystify our token structure, distribution mechanisms, and the inherent value propositions.</li>\n<li><strong>Protocol Growth</strong>: To ensure the sustainable growth of Optimism, our mission requests should emphasize strategies that increase user adoption, enhance protocol functionalities, and expand into new horizons or use cases.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By focusing on these pillars, I believe we’ll be strategically positioned to drive forward the ambitions of Season 5, ensuring Optimism’s growth, sustainability, and community-centric ethos.</p>\n<p><strong>Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:</strong> None.</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you agree to abide by the Code of Conduct:</strong> Yes, I wholeheartedly agree.</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand KYC will be required to receive Council rewards at the end of Season 5:</strong> I fully understand and comply with the KYC requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you are able to commit ~20 hours / week to reviewing grant applications and other Council operations:</strong> I am entirely committed and can comfortably allocate the required hours.</p>'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Delegates  🏛', 'thread_title': 'Token House participation and incentives: an extended analysis', 'creation_time': '2024-03-25T08:09:04.452000+00:00', 'username': 'Oakfloors', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 1, 'id': '41.6479.35369'}, page_content='<p>Hi, I’m new here so apologize if my reply is outside of the discussion.</p>\n<p>I think I’m a potential future delegate that could help with the workload described here but I am not as of today.

The goal for this project is that the population of the city should understand what the letters that we send them actually means. It shouldn’t be too much to ask for but it’s really difficult to do in practise.</p>\n<p>We have started the process by training volunteers to “read” official documents that we send out and give us feedback on how they <strong>feel</strong> when reading. Example: “I feel overwhelmed when I look at this document. I don’t even want to start reading because there’s just too much text”. This person was not one who struggled with the local language or in general.</p>\n<p>My feeling when entering <a href=""http://gov.optimism.io"">gov.optimism.io</a> is “I’m overwhelmed, where should I start”.

How can I get test tokens on the OP Goerli network?,"There are a few options to get test tokens on the OP Goerli network:

1. Faucets:
- Paradigm's MultiFaucet (https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) allows you to get test ETH on OP Goerli and other testnets.
- Coinbase Faucet (https://coinbase.com/faucets/optimism-goerli-faucet) provides test ETH for OP Goerli via the Coinbase Wallet extension or website.
- QuickNode Faucet (https://faucet.quicknode.com/optimism/) offers test ETH for OP Goerli and OP Sepolia.

2. ERC-20 Test Tokens:
Optimism has deployed several ERC-20 test token contracts on OP Goerli. These contracts have a ""faucet"" function that allows you to mint 1000 tokens for testing purposes.

3. Wrapped ETH (WETH):
Both OP Mainnet and OP Goerli have a WETH contract at address 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006. You can get WETH by wrapping your test ETH.

4. Bridge from Goerli:
If you already have Goerli ETH, you can bridge it over to the OP Goerli network using the Optimism bridge (https://app.optimism.io/bridge).

1. Use a faucet:
- The QuickNode faucet (https://faucet.quicknode.com/optimism/) allows you to get testnet ETH for both OP Goerli and OP Sepolia networks.
- The Superchain Faucet (https://app.optimism.io/faucet) provided by Optimism Labs lets you get free testnet ETH for OP Sepolia and other Optimism test networks.

2. Bridge ETH from Ethereum Sepolia testnet:
- Get testnet ETH from an Ethereum Sepolia faucet like https://sepoliafaucet.com/
- Use the L1StandardBridge or Superchain Testnet Tools to bridge that Sepolia ETH over to the OP Sepolia testnet.

3. Use the Optimism Gateway:
- You can bridge a small amount of real ETH from Ethereum mainnet to OP Sepolia using the Optimism Gateway (https://gateway.optimism.io/) to pay for deployment gas fees.

How can I participate in Token House governance without a significant time commitment?,"There are a few ways you can participate in Optimism's Token House governance without a major time commitment:

1. Delegate your voting power to a trusted delegate. You can find active delegates and review their profiles on sites like optimism.showkarma.xyz. Delegating allows the delegate to vote on proposals on your behalf while you retain the ability to un-delegate at any time.

2. Review and vote on governance proposals directly through snapshot voting. While this requires more effort than delegating, you can choose which proposals to review and vote on based on your interests and availability. The key is not to feel obligated to vote on every single proposal.

3. Engage on the Optimism Governance Forums. You can read discussions, share your perspectives, and upvote/downvote comments without a huge time commitment. This allows you to stay informed and contribute your voice.

4. Join governance calls or AMAs when your schedule allows. These are opportunities to listen in and ask questions without preparatory work required.

The main thing is to participate at whatever level works for your schedule. Even smaller contributions like delegating or occasionally voting on proposals that interest you can be valuable to the governance process.

How can I report a bug or suggest a feature for the Optimism SDK?,"Based on the information provided, there are a few ways you can report a bug or suggest a new feature for the Optimism SDK:

1. Open an issue on GitHub
The documentation mentions that if you can't find what you're looking for, one option is to ""make an issue on GitHub"". This suggests you can open a new issue on the relevant Optimism GitHub repository to report a bug or request a new feature.

2. Ask on Discord
Another recommended option is to ask on the Optimism Discord server. The documentation mentions you can ""ask us a question in Discord"" if you need additional help. The Discord community would be a good place to discuss bugs or desired features.

3. Contribute directly 
If you want to contribute code changes directly, the documentation provides a link to read more about ""technical contributions"" to the Optimism codebase. This may allow you to submit bug fixes or new features as pull requests.

4. Reach out for developer support
For developer-specific issues, the documentation mentions the ""TechNERD program"" which seems to provide technical support. Reaching out through this channel may allow you to get assistance in reporting SDK bugs or requesting enhancements.

In summary, the recommended paths are opening a GitHub issue, asking on Discord, contributing code directly, or potentially reaching out through the developer support channels.

How can I start the process of becoming an Optimism Ambassador?,"Based on the information provided, here are the key steps to become an Optimism Ambassador:

1. Check that you are aligned with the values and mission of Optimism. Ambassadors are highly values-aligned with Optimism's vision and are passionate about helping onboard millions of users into the Optimism ecosystem through education.

2. Go through the contribution path which has three stages:
   - wannabe-ambassador
   - ambassador-in-training  
   - ambassador

3. During the ""wannabe-ambassador"" stage, start creating value-focused content that helps form the narrative around the Optimism ecosystem. This could include writing, design, visuals, etc. 

4. The pre-flight checklist states that Optimism Ambassadors love to collaborate, help others grow in the program, create value-focused content, and value initiatives like retroactive public goods funding.

5. Consistently produce high-quality educational content aligned with Optimism's goals. Demonstrate your ability to effectively communicate the Optimism vision.

6. After proving your commitment during the ""wannabe-ambassador"" stage, you may be promoted to ""ambassador-in-training"" where you can further collaborate with existing Ambassadors.

7. Finally, if you meet all the criteria, you can become an official ""Optimism Ambassador"" helping to onboard and educate new users and builders into the Optimism ecosystem.

How does Optimism ensure that its protocol remains sustainable?,"According to the Optimism documentation, sustainability is a core design principle that actively influences the protocol's development. Optimism aims to build a system that can remain operational and competitive over the long-term. Some key points about how Optimism ensures sustainability:

1. Simplicity - Optimism keeps its codebase simple to allow a larger community of contributors to maintain and improve the protocol long-term. Complex codebases are harder for outside developers to contribute to.

2. Iterative Approach - Optimism takes an iterative, experimental approach to governance to allow time to build robust processes and an engaged community over time. This increases chances of successful long-term evolution.

3. Open Source - Supporting the protocol as an open source project encourages community involvement in building out the technical architecture for scalability, security and decentralization.

4. Decentralizing Governance - The Optimism Foundation currently facilitates governance processes, but aims to gradually decentralize this role by coordinating contributors to create technical and governance foundations for self-sustaining governance by the community over time.

5. Security Focus - Initiatives like bug bounty programs help ensure the protocol's security posture remains strong as it evolves, building confidence for long-term sustainability.

How does Optimism's bi-cameral governance system help prevent plutocratic governance?,"Optimism's bi-cameral governance system, with a Token House and a Citizens' House, helps prevent plutocratic governance in a few key ways:

1. It balances token holder voting power with a one-person-one-vote system. While the Token House represents the economic stake of OP token holders, the Citizens' House gives an equal voice to individual human participants, preventing whales from having outsized control.

2. There are checks and balances between the two houses. For major decisions like protocol upgrades and sequencer selection, the Token House proposes but the Citizens' House has the ability to veto, acting as a check on the token holders' power.

3. The Citizens' House is responsible for allocating retroactive public goods funding (RetroPGF) to projects that benefit the Optimism ecosystem. This funding is not determined solely by token stakes.

4. Over time, more responsibilities may shift to the Citizens' House to further decentralize decision-making away from just financial stakes.

So in essence, the bi-cameral model recognizes that token holders are one important constituency, but prevents them from being the sole decision makers. The Citizens' House counterbalances their influence with a more egalitarian, human-centric voting structure and the ability to veto certain economic decisions that could disproportionately benefit token whales over the broader community.",14.47420620918274,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Delegates  🏛', 'thread_title': 'Top 20% of delegates consolidate 82% of all delegated voting power.

For context, we fully buy into the idea of the collective as a common; which, in turn, requires proper governing for the benefit of all users. We believe that the best way to achieve quality governance is through comparison with existing governance structures and thought.</p>\n<p>In The Politics, Aristotle discusses the typologies of various governments and concludes that the most just form of governance is the “Polity”. We believe that, intentionally or unintentionally, the bicameral legislature of the Optimism Collective is descended from Aristotelian thinking. Aristotle argues that there are essentially two ways in which a government can allocate power to its constituents: by worth and by number. Aristotle’s definition of worth is antiquated–it refers to nobility as well as wealth–but it is still useful in describing the underlying philosophy of the bicameral legislature.</p>\n<p>Those who hold a significant voting share, delegated or owned outright, must be duly considered according to that voting share. If not, there is a significant risk that animosity will develop toward constituents’ allocated votes based on number (the Citizen House). However, as is clear both in history and especially in blockchain, this animosity will lead to more oligarchic governance. We do not believe that Optimism Governance has reached the point of oligarchism. If the top 20% of delegates control 82% of delegated tokens (32MM OP), this only amounts to approximately 11.2% of the circulating supply (~234MM OP).</p>\n<p>Ideally, the Citizen House would be able to check this control, but they only have control over retroactive public goods funding. In The Discourses, Machiavelli, observes that one of the primary reasons for the liberty experienced by the Roman people in the Republican Period was the role of the Tribune of the Plebeians. In short, this was a person who had the ability to veto the actions of the oligarchical upper class, in defence of the people.</p>\n<p>We believe that in order to create the most successful L2 protocol, it would be in the interest of all parties to expand the rights of the Citizen House to include the veto of a proposal, by the majority vote of a quorum of citizens.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that we believe that the citizens should have outright control over the protocol–only that there should be greater checks against the ability to purchase outsized control over the ecosystem. We also believe that it would be beneficial to expand the number of delegates. This would further diversify control among the existing delegates and lead to a more pluralistic Token House.</p>\n<p>Quentin Bazar, Georgetown Blockchain</p>'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Governance  Design 📐', 'thread_title': 'The Future of Optimism Governance', 'creation_time': '2023-07-19T12:16:25.861000+00:00', 'username': 'bobby', 'moderator': True, 'admin': True, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '84.6471.28329'}, page_content='<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Optimism Foundation recently published this as a <a href=""https://optimism.mirror.xyz/PLrAQgE1EGRo7GRrFoztplFChnUZda4DFGW3dkQayxY"">post on our Mirror blog</a>.

The Token House is made up of OP holders and their delegates, and the Citizens’ House is a one-person-one-vote system based on reputation.</p>\n<p>This two-house design is intended to help the Collective make good decisions and avoid common pitfalls in token-based governance systems. Tokenholders represent one constituency out of many, and are not always the right unilateral owners for decisions that don’t involve the economics of the system. Creating two distinct branches of governance with different membership criteria allows the Collective to match constituents’ incentives with different types of decisions. It also helps the Collective avoid concentration of power, enact safeguards via checks and balances, and evaluate decisions from broader perspectives.</p>\n<p>This is not a new concept. Bi- or tri-cameral governance systems have existed for centuries. With a new iteration of a known pattern, Optimism aims to build a governance system that will stand the test of time and help the Collective flourish.</p>\n<p>This post provides an overview of the goals, design principles, and problem spaces of Optimism Governance. It is not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance processes will be introduced and implemented: it’s highly likely the Collective will learn from initial experiments and make modifications to the rules and processes outlined here. These “Problem Spaces” are intended as starting points for discussion.</p>\n<h2><a name=""governance-goals-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#governance-goals-2""></a>Governance Goals</h2>\n<p>There are two primary goals of Optimism’s governance system:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Capture resistance.</strong> Governance plays a key role in securing the anti-capture and censorship resistance of the Optimism protocol. Governance should (a) make it possible for chain or network operation to continue without reliance on any individual entity, and (b) prevent any one entity or small group of entities from being able to control or censor the protocol or its functions.</li>\n<li><strong>Resource allocation.</strong> Governance’s second primary responsibility is to allocate resources effectively to support the Collective’s vision and accrue sustainable value to the Optimism Collective. Vision &amp; value may often be in conflict, and allocating resources effectively involves a blend of short- and long-term thinking. This includes allocation of both the token treasury and protocol revenue.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=""design-principles-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#design-principles-3""></a>Design Principles</h2>\n<p>Design decisions for the Collective’s governance system should be made in line with three key principles:</p>\n<p><strong>Governance minimization</strong>. The set of governance responsibilities that are encoded onchain or formalized in voting processes should remain as minimal as possible. The Collective aims to reduce governance to its essence and to avoid introducing regulation where freedom can achieve the same result. This principle is key to encouraging permissionless innovation. In practice, this looks like a minimal set of (1) onchain governance processes to upgrade Optimism contracts and tune the economic parameters of the system, and (2) offchain social processes to maintain a healthy community.</p>\n<p><strong>Iteration</strong>. Optimism is decentralizing iteratively to increase the chances of building a healthy system that lasts for the long-term. This means the Foundation will play a role in establishing processes, help the Collective through its first few rapid feedback loops in improving those processes, then reduce its role over time. (This also means the design principles and goals outlined in this document may be invalidated or updated along the way.) This iteration gives the Collective a chance to learn how to make thoughtful decisions using an un-intuitive but essential loop: introduce a governance process that involves active participation, then gradually work to automate or minimize it over time. Governance’s responsibility then becomes to adjust the autopilot when necessary, not to keep two hands on the wheel.</p>\n<p><strong>Forking</strong>. The right to fork and the right to exit are critical to protect individual freedoms. All of the core software and tooling required to run the Optimism network should be made open source, freely available, and easy to use such that a fork is always a viable alternative. This isn’t just about vibes: in crypto, where credible commitments not to extract are <a href=""https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/when-is-decentralizing-on-a-blockchain-valuable/"">what makes decentralized platforms valuable</a>, this is a competitive advantage. Participants will be more likely to join Optimism if they have the ability to make an alternative.</p>\n<p><strong>Balance</strong>. Influence in governance must extend beyond financial stake to value humanhood and intelligent life. The centralizing force of plutocratic token governance must be balanced with Citizenship. Giving voice and power to different constituents allows the Collective to match decisions with voters’ incentives, rather than building a solely plutocratic system. Checks and balances prevent capture.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact = profit.</strong> A key part of the Optimistic Vision is to ensure that every individual is rewarded in proportion to their positive impact to the Collective. We believe this to be the most important target in the pursuit of solving global coordination problems and creating a better future. Our economy is an expression of our collective needs, wants, and ethics. Optimism Governance is ultimately responsible for enacting this fairness ratio that is key to the Optimistic Vision.</p>\n<h2><a name=""design-overview-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#design-overview-4""></a>Design Overview</h2>\n<p>The responsibilities of Optimism Governance can be categorized into one of the two primary goals of the governance system: <strong>Capture Resistance</strong> and <strong>Resource Allocation</strong>. Within each category, governance responsibilities are identified as (a) the exclusive responsibility of one or the other house, (b) a responsibility where one house drives proposals and the other house may veto, or (c) as a truly shared responsibility subject to approval by each house. This system is designed to help each house play to its strengths and avoid deadlock.</p>\n<p>The Optimism <strong>Token House</strong> is made up of OP tokenholders and their delegates. Tokenholders and their delegates are expected to be rational economic actors interested in preserving or increasing the economic well-being of the Optimism Collective. Therefore, the Token House is responsible for decisions that affect business parameters of the system such as inflation or the variables that govern sequencer selection. Token voting is distributed widely and permissionlessly and helps represent the free market in the Collective’s decision making.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the Token House, the <strong>Citizens’ House</strong> uses a one-person, one-vote system. Citizens are meant to represent individual human stakeholders of the Collective: builders, users, and community members who are aligned with the project’s values and are interested in the long-term benefit of the Collective. Therefore, the Citizens’ House is responsible for decisions that may require prioritizing long term growth ahead of other goals – decisions like allocating funding to public goods that support the Collective. In the long term, we can expect the Citizens’ House to expand to include the thousands or millions or billions of humans interacting with Optimism.</p>\n<p>Governance responsibilities given to each house will change over time as the Collective iterates towards its long-term governance-minimized end state. This includes introducing highly manual governance responsibilities (e.g. inflation adjustments, or Superchain allowlists) that are intended to be replaced by automated smart defaults as the Collective learns how to govern these vectors appropriately. It may also include transitioning powers from the responsibility of the full governance body to a subset of governance participants who are empowered by their broader governance base.</p>\n<p>In these early chapters of Collective governance, many of these iterations have been designed or implemented by the Optimism Foundation. Eventually this must transition to the responsibility of Collective governance itself. This meta-governance power marks the end of the Foundation’s stewardship of the evolution of Collective governance and entrusts the governance community with continued experimentation towards a healthy end-state for Optimism.</p>\n<p>So: what does governance… well, govern?</p>\n<h2><a name=""problem-space-1-capture-resistance-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#problem-space-1-capture-resistance-5""></a><strong>Problem Space <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#1:</span> Capture Resistance</strong></h2>\n<p>Optimism Governance’s first responsibility is to ensure that no single party can unilaterally control, censor, halt, or otherwise extract rent from Optimism. A decentralized compute layer is hardly valuable if controlled by a centralized entity. Governance helps the Collective make decisions in the absence of any one person or organization that is “in charge.”</p>\n<p>The responsibility to uphold capture resistance can be broken down into two broad categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>hard powers:</strong> governance powers that are eventually encoded and executed onchain, and</li>\n<li><strong>soft powers:</strong> social norms the governance community upholds, not enforced onchain but by the community’s ability to fork.<br>\n<br></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>1/ Hard powers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Protocol Upgrades</strong> refer to the ability for governance to make changes to the OP Stack protocol itself. This is a crucial responsibility of governance that ultimately makes the community the steward of Optimism’s core protocol functionality.</p>\n<p>Protocol upgrades will be approved by the Token House, subject to a Citizens’ House veto. The Token House is the primary approver because of its broad reach and likelihood of representing business interests that depend on the OP Stack’s functionality. The Citizens’ House veto power guards against capture of the Token House and increases the resilience of the overall system.</p>\n<p>Today, protocol upgrades are approved by the Token House and executed manually by the Optimism Foundation. In the coming Seasons, the Collective may implement a Security Council responsible for executing upgrades following the will of governance. The Citizens’ House veto power comes online in Season 5 (H1 2023), when the Citizens’ House comes fully online. Eventually, execution of protocol upgrades will be fully onchain. On a far enough time horizon, we can expect protocol upgrades to become less and less common as the protocol nears feature completeness. We can look to protocols like Ethereum and Bitcoin as a model for what mature decentralized protocol upgrades look like.</p>\n<p><strong>Sequencer Selection</strong> is the ability to make choices about which parties may act as sequencers for OP Chains or in shared sequencing schemes.</p>\n<p>This begins as an explicit governance power driven by the Token House, with Citizens’ House power to veto. Sequencers are important economic actors for OP Chains and eventually for the Superchain. The Token House is well-incentivized to make sure sequencer selection is fair and beneficial for the Collective. The Citizens’ House veto power guards against the capture of the Token House related to sequencer selection.</p>\n<p>Today, OP Chains are sequenced by a handful of different entities. In Season 5, those sequencers will submit proposals to Optimism Governance to be formally included in the Superchain, officially bringing the hard power of sequencer selection into the hands of the Collective. More information about this governance process will be shared in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Eventually, sequencer selection may be fully automated based on verifiable and pre-agreed upon processes, enabling the sequencer set to be curated and maintained without active governance intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Citizenship Eligibility</strong> is the responsibility of governance to select new humans to participate in the Citizens’ House of Optimism Governance.</p>\n<p>Citizenship Eligibility will be determined by the Citizens’ House; the Token House will have the power to veto. Assuming good long-term values alignment with the Collective, Citizens should be incentivized to grow a set of voters that make quality decisions about RetroPGF allocations. A Token House veto guards against capture of the Citizens’ House or moves to consolidate power.</p>\n<p>To date, Citizenship expansion has been administered by the Foundation. In the future, the Foundation will propose an expansion algorithm that Citizens vote to approve. Ultimately, Citizens may govern a citizenship selection algorithm directly that runs across identity data in the Optimism AttestationStation. In its final minimized form, the Citizens’ House has established a battle-tested onchain selection process; updates to the contracts that govern selection can be made as necessary by the Citizens’ House.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>2/ Soft powers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Code of Conduct Enforcement</strong> is the responsibility of governance to uphold and enforce the Optimism Collective Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>Each house may govern the code of conduct for its own members. The best cultural and values-based enforcement for governance communities should come from within that specific community.</p>\n<p>Today, CoC violations are processed with administration from the Foundation. In future Seasons, the community will iterate on this approach: Season 4 includes an <a href=""https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2"">RFP for Code of Conduct research</a>, and Season 6 may introduce a new Council to replace the Foundation’s role in this process. As a soft power, Code of Conduct enforcement will not be implemented onchain. For example, if a Token House delegate were to violate the Code of Conduct, that delegate would not be prevented from voting by an update to Optimism’s voting contracts onchain. Rather, the community could enforce its rules and norms on the social layer by choosing to remove the participant from delegation frontends and UIs, or by informing the tokenholders who’ve delegated to the offending party of the breach in conduct.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Removal</strong> is the right of governance to remove a director of the Optimism Foundation. Director Removals are approved by the Token House.</p>\n<p>This right is enforced and upheld by the Founding Documents of the Optimism Collective. As such, the Token House may vote to veto any reduction of this power. As Directors are not represented onchain, this responsibility does not have onchain enforceability.</p>\n<h2><a name=""problem-space-2-resource-allocation-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#problem-space-2-resource-allocation-6""></a><strong>Problem Space <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#2:</span> Resource Allocation</strong></h2>\n<p>The second primary responsibility of Optimism governance is to allocate the Collective’s resources to help it achieve its goals. This is a piece of essential governance that requires human intervention, especially in its early stages. Resource allocation in the Collective comes in three forms:</p>\n<p><strong>1/ Allocation of Protocol Revenue</strong><br>\n<strong>2/ OP Treasury Management</strong><br>\n<strong>3/ RetroPGF Funding</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Allocation of Protocol Revenue</strong> is the responsibility of governance to determine how to direct surplus ETH generated by the Optimism protocol. Optimism generates revenue through transaction fees paid on OP Mainnet and other OP Chains. Part of these transaction fees is used to post data to Ethereum L1 and pay for other expenses associated with running the protocol, and the remainder of the fee is accumulated as surplus revenue that can be directed by the Collective for the benefit of the Collective. In the future, the sequencing and proving networks that help run the Optimism protocol may also provide sources of revenue for the Collective.</p>\n<p>By default, surplus protocol revenue will be allocated to RetroPGF. The Token House may vote on proposals to divert a portion of the surplus protocol revenue for other Optimism Collective purposes as they see fit. These proposals will be subject to veto right by the Citizens’ House.</p>\n<p>Protocol Revenue is a crucial lever in the Collective. In its early stages, the default allocation to RetroPGF lets the Collective reward projects that grow the Optimism ecosystem. As Optimism matures, the Token House is entrusted to propose deviations from this default for the health of the Optimism Collective. Citizens’ House veto powers help hold the Token House accountable and prevent short term optimization at the expense of long term sustainability.</p>\n<p>In a future governance season, a proposal type will be introduced for proposing modifications to the allocation of surplus protocol revenue. These proposals may begin with certain safeguards, like a cap on possible allocations. Proposal power for high-level budgeting decisions may additionally be delegated to elected representatives as the Token House sees fit. The long term minimized state of this governance responsibility could include some thoughtful automation to determine revenue allocations based on indicators of whether the Collective should be in a “growth” stage or “value” stage.</p>\n<p><strong>OP Treasury Allocation</strong> is the responsibility of governance to direct how the existing OP token treasury is allocated. This has several components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <strong>Governance Fund</strong>, which is directed by Token House governance.</li>\n<li>The <strong>RetroPGF Fund</strong>, which is directed by Citizens’ House governance, subject to a Token House veto.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Seed Fund</strong> and <strong>Unallocated</strong> portions of the token treasury, which are initially administered by the Foundation, and will eventually be directed jointly by both houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Foundation Budget Approvals</strong>, which are governed jointly by both houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Inflation adjustments</strong>, which are governed by the Token House, subject to a Citizens’ House veto.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This distributed ownership of the OP Treasury allows for flexibility and gives each house a clear mechanism to allocate tokens for the development of the Collective. Today, treasury allocations are administered by the Foundation, and will gradually move onchain as the governance system matures and becomes more resilient. In the long term, as most of the Treasury is circulating, this power will boil down to the governance of inflation, which can be automated to a thoughtful set of defaults based on the economic health of the Collective.</p>\n<p><strong>RetroPGF Grants</strong> are the responsibility of governance to allocate RetroPGF to projects that have provided public good to the Optimism Collective. These grants may refer to either (a) OP tokens from the RetroPGF Fund portion of the token treasury (see OP Treasury Allocation), or (b) Profits generated by the Optimism Protocol that governance has decided to allocate to RetroPGF (see Allocation of Protocol Revenue). Specifically, this responsibility includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>RetroPGF Scope</strong>: the ability of governance to update the scope, metrics, and impact evaluation criteria used in determining how RetroPGF Grants are allocated to projects. In line with the principle of governance minimization, this should be a soft power.</li>\n<li><strong>Project Allocations</strong>: the ability of the Citizens’ House to make specific individual project-level decisions about how the RetroPGF Scope is applied to allocate grants. This is the corresponding hard power for RetroPGF.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both components of RetroPGF Grants above are the responsibility of the Citizens’ House. Citizens are selected as individual humans who are interested in the long term health of the Optimism Collective, and RetroPGF is a long term investment in Optimism’s growth.</p>\n<p>Today, the Foundation identifies RetroPGF scope and Citizens make Project Allocation decisions. Eventually, Citizens will govern RetroPGF scope themselves.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Altogether, this looks like the diagram below:</p>\n<p><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339.png"" data-download-href=""/uploads/short-url/caEzKbwfX1MMuFTjinRTEdM3vVD.png?dl=1"" title=""""><img src=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_690x345.png"" alt="""" data-base62-sha1=""caEzKbwfX1MMuFTjinRTEdM3vVD"" width=""690"" height=""345"" role=""presentation"" srcset=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_690x345.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_1035x517.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_1380x690.png 2x"" data-dominant-color=""23212B""><div class=""meta""><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#far-image""></use></svg><span class=""filename""></span><span class=""informations"">3840×1921 572 KB</span><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#discourse-expand""></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<h2><a name=""additional-notes-7"" class=""anchor"" href=""#additional-notes-7""></a>Additional Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Incompleteness</strong></p>\n<p>The list above does not include all governance powers – it notably excludes governance responsibilities, especially social ones.</p>\n<p>The list above is also not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance powers will be rolled out and implemented.

In particular, it’s important to note that all veto powers are not created equal.

These thresholds determine the balance of power in responsibilities shared between houses and must be considered carefully.</p>\n<p>The Collective will apply the principle of iteration in introducing these checks, balances, and vetos.

Several factors come into play here, including the ways identity and contribution history can help inform citizenship eligibility; public and private voting strategies to help prevent collusion and bribery; citizenship incentives; escape hatches and metagovernance in the event of capture; and the iterative path towards growing the set of Citizens and their responsibilities. These important topics will be discussed in greater detail in a future post.</p>\n<h1><a name=""key-milestones-8"" class=""anchor"" href=""#key-milestones-8""></a>Key Milestones</h1>\n<p>Optimism Governance continues to make steady strides towards a robust and sustainable system.

More information about sequencer governance (and its relation to chain, user, and platform governance) will be shared in the coming weeks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Joint-House voting</strong><br>\nIn Season 5, the Collective will bring the Citizens’ House fully online and execute its first set of joint-house votes.

The Security Council is a set of community members tasked with executing protocol upgrades at the will of governance. This replaces the multisig wallet controlled by the Optimism Foundation and marks an important milestone in protocol decentralization.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=""season-6-2024-10"" class=""anchor"" href=""#season-6-2024-10""></a><strong>Season 6 [2024]</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Protocol Revenue Allocation</strong><br>\nSeason 6 will introduce the initial process for votes to allocate Protocol Revenue. It’s possible this process will include the introduction of a Treasury Council responsible for making high-level proposals to governance about how to allocate resources; any proposal for protocol revenue allocation will be submitted to the Token House for approval, and to the Citizens’ House for veto.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Onchain treasury execution</strong><br>\nIn Season 6, parts of the Optimism Treasury will move onchain.

How does Retro Funding 4 plan to reward the use of Open Source licenses?,"According to the information provided, in Retro Funding Round 4, badgeholders (voters) will have the option to assign a multiplier to projects that use Open Source licenses for their contract code. Specifically:

- During the application process, projects will need to provide the GitHub repository containing their contract code.

- The licenses used by projects will be identified from these GitHub repos.

- The Open Source Initiative's definition will be used to classify licenses as open source or not.

- In the voting interface, badgeholders will have the ability to apply a multiplier (e.g. 5x) to projects using open source licenses for their contract code repositories.

- Badgeholders will also have the option to completely exclude non-open source projects from receiving any allocation.

The stated rationale is that rewarding open source is one of the Optimism Collective's values, as open source code promotes innovation, permissionless experimentation and knowledge sharing. However, there was some debate around this approach, with concerns raised that it oversimplifies the nuances around open source licensing and could undervalue high-impact projects that use a mix of open and closed source code.",16.09641981124878,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Retro  Funding 🔴', 'thread_title': 'Retro Funding 4: Voting Experience', 'creation_time': '2024-05-15T18:10:13.916000+00:00', 'username': 'Jonas', 'moderator': True, 'admin': False, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '46.8138.36894'}, page_content='<p>Hey <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/alexcutlerdoteth"">@alexcutlerdoteth</a>!

In its current form, it’s not practical to make claims on the “open source percentage of a project”, as this requires to judge the importance of each piece of code of a project. As flagged in the post, we’re very open to suggestions for how this could be achieved!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>no distinctions to be made between the multitude of different types of licenses and their purposes, that simply if a builder is asking for permission for reusing any portion of their work, their impact may be systematically ignored - and that some builder who forked OS portions of their code should rewarded at 5x the value. <strong>This is frankly shocking and runs against the purpose of Retro Funding.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The definition of the <a href=""https://opensource.org/"">Open Source Initiative</a> is applied to classify licenses as open source. While this can be a controversial topic, the Open Source Initative’s classification is the most widely accepted and used framework.</p>\n<p>As we’re implementing this as a multiplier, this means that using an open source license in isolation is not rewarded, but that instead badgeholders can add this as an additional consideration to reward impact.</p>\n<h2><a name=""allowing-badgeholders-to-make-informed-decisions-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#allowing-badgeholders-to-make-informed-decisions-2""></a>Allowing badgeholders to make informed decisions</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But in making a design choice to allow voters a one-click exclusion or 5x boost exclusively for OS—and ignore other important characteristics, such as VC funding or open tokenomics—the Collective seems to be implying that 100% OSS is <em><strong>necessarily</strong></em> more impactful than even 99.99% OSS, which is, frankly, indefensible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In our user testing, we have received strong feedback from badgeholders that they want this functionality.

Badgeholders are shown a table and graph with their OP allocation, which is based on the impact metrics they weighted and the open source multiplier. Within the table badgeholders can see the resulting allocation of OP to each project, filter based on the performance against specific impact metrics and the open source multipler and discover which projects are labeled as open source.<br>\nWhen badgeholders use the multiplier, they will see how the table and graph is updated to reflect that (see screenshot below).

The Optimism Collective believes that building open source gives rise to rapid innovation, permissionless experimentation and open knowledge sharing. It is core to combatting the centralization of power and lowering the barriers to entry for builders within the Collective. This leads to increased competition, higher quality products for users and less value extraction. One of Retro Funding’s core goals is to reward open source contributions which benefit the Collective.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The notion that having even a single repository with some sort of license is enough to label the entire project closed-source is a bar that not even Optimism would clear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=""https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism"">OP Stack</a> is MIT licensed and has a large number of forks. The Optimism specs repo, which outlines the specs of the OP Stack, is currently under a Creative Commons 1.0 Universal license, which is not considered as open source by the Open Source Initiative, but is a public domain dedication which allows anyone to build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute.<br>\nIn Retro Funding 4, for a project to be considered open source, only the repo which contains their contract code needs to be under an open source license, not all repos which the organization owns need to fulfil that requirement. Thus, the OP Stack would pass the test.</p>\n<p>Regarding concerns on the missing license on the OP-Atlas repo, we’re in the process of building this (you can see that the repo is only a few weeks old). We’ll add an open source license to it shortly.</p>\n<p>Allowing badgeholders to reward the use of open source licenses also does not imply that the Optimism Foundation or OP Labs team requires all partners that it references, or uses to build products, to be open source.</p>\n<h2><a name=""thoughtful-implementation-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#thoughtful-implementation-4""></a>Thoughtful implementation</h2>\n<p>The team has invested lots of time into getting this feature to a state in which we feel confident.

Impact will be rewarded within the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demand generated for Optimism Blockspace</li>\n<li>Interactions from repeat Optimism users</li>\n<li>Interactions from Optimism users with high trust scores</li>\n<li>Interactions of new Optimism users</li>\n<li>Open Source license of contract code</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=""eligibility-criteria-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#eligibility-criteria-4""></a>Eligibility Criteria</h2>\n<p>In Retro Funding 3, the Retro Funding sign up process saw a large influx of spam and low-quality applications. By setting stronger eligibility criteria in Retro Funding 4, the Foundation aims to provide clarity to builders and reduce the amount of human review required for spam and low-quality application. In addition, qualifying criteria reduce the number of applicants who have not generated sufficient impact to receive rewards (such as the below requirement of a minimum number of unique address interactions). The below eligibility criteria aim to strike a balance between broad inclusivity and sufficient requirements to allow for an operationally viable Retro Funding round.</p>\n<p><strong>Builders are eligible who have</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deployed their onchain contracts on one or multiple of the following OP chains: OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal and Metal, and meet the following criteria:\n<ul>\n<li>Onchain contracts have interactions from 420 unique addresses during Jan 1st - May 1st 2024</li>\n<li>Onchain contracts had their first transaction before April 1st 2024</li>\n<li>Onchain contract had more than 10 days of activity during Jan 1st - May 1st 2024</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Verified their onchain contracts in the Retro Funding sign up process</li>\n<li>Made their contract code available in a public Github repo, for which ownership has been verified in the Retro Funding sign up process</li>\n<li>Confirmed that they will comply with Optimism Foundation KYC requirements and are not residing in a sanctioned country</li>\n<li>Submitted a Retro Funding application before June 6th, 2024 and comply with application rules</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=""round-sizing-10m-op-to-reward-onchain-builders-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#round-sizing-10m-op-to-reward-onchain-builders-5""></a>Round Sizing: 10m OP to reward Onchain Builders</h2>\n<p>Retro Funding 4 will allocated 10m OP to reward the impact of Onchain Builders. The OP token allocation for Retro Funding 4 should reflect the impact generated by onchain builders, as well as set a strong incentive for the continuous generation of demand for Optimism blockspace.<br>\nBelow you find some considerations which informed the Foundation’s round sizing decision:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Underallocation to Onchain Builders in Retro Funding 3:</strong> Previously, Retro Funding 3 allocated a total of <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521"">1.5M out of 30M OP</a> to the top 20% of applicants who generated network usage. There has been <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521"">strong feedback from badgeholders and community</a> members that this allocation was too low and should be increased in future rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Growth in developer activity since last round:</strong> The Collective is focused on growing the number of active onchain developers. Developer activity, across the Superchain, <a href=""https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity#op-chains-revenue-generating-deployer-addresses"">has seen a large increase over the past six months</a>. Thus, Retro Funding rewards to these types of contributions should increase to reflect this increase in impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Collective sustainability:</strong> In Retro Funding 3, badgeholders have <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521"">raised concerns around Retro Funding sustainability</a>. Retro Funding currently relies on the Retroactive Public Goods Funding token allocation of 850M OP for rewards. <a href=""https://optimism.mirror.xyz/PLrAQgE1EGRo7GRrFoztplFChnUZda4DFGW3dkQayxY"">In the future</a>, Retro Funding will rely on surplus protocol revenue as the source of rewards. Currently, <a href=""https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity#op-collective-contribution"">Total Collective Contributions</a> (of surplus protocol revenue) fall short of what is needed to sustain Retroactive Public Goods Funding. Additionally, in Retro Funding 3, badgeholders raised points <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521"">around the relationship of rewards to the sequencer revenue</a>, to ensure rewards don’t exceed the sequencer revenue itself. By allocating a significant amount of OP to rewarding onchain builders, the Citizens’ House is incentivizing developer growth and increased network activity.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=""future-round-sizing-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#future-round-sizing-6""></a>Future round sizing</h3>\n<p>The Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 &amp; 5, and will proposes round sizes for Retro Funding 6 &amp; 7, to be ratified by the Citizens’ House. In the future, this process will gradually transition to be more community-led, which may involve the creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons. Round sizing decisions are currently informed by the amount of impact observed within the Collective, considerations for incentivising contributors to take action, and sustainability of Retro Funding rewards. In the future, these decisions should be made based on a framework which takes a number of established measurements and criteria into. We invite Data NERDs to explore measurements and criteria which will inform governance participants to make informed budgeting decisions in the future.</p>\n<h2><a name=""voting-design-7"" class=""anchor"" href=""#voting-design-7""></a>Voting design</h2>\n<p>Retro Funding 4 experiments with <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/upcoming-retro-rounds-and-their-design/7861"">Metrics-based Evaluation</a>, with the hypothesis that by leveraging quantitive metrics, citizens are able to more accurately express their preferences for the types of impact they want to reward, as well as make more accurate judgements of the impact delivered by individual contributors.<br>\nIn stark contrast to other Retro Funding experiments, badgeholders will not vote on individual projects but will rather vote via selecting and weighting a number of metrics which measure different types of impact.

Upon sign-up, Warpcast currently charges a $7 fee to rent storage on the network. As a decentralized social network, Farcaster content is not stored on centrally controlled servers, but rather in Hubs, which are a [distributed network of servers](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/hubs). Each unit of storage buys 5000 casts, 2500 reactions and 2500 follows. For those who prefer to register a Farcaster account via contracts directly, this can be done via the [ID Registry Contract](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/contracts). Storage can be rented via the [Storage Registry Contract](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/contracts).

While this new round of Retro Funding made some promising changes, I am very concerned about some of the suggestions made above.</p>\n<p>At issue is adding an overly-simplistic binary choice for Badgeholders to penalize projects that have even one line of code contained within them that requires some sort of permission to reuse.

A clear value prop to attract world-class builders to the Superchain. No qualifiers, no asterisks; just build impactful stuff here, and you’ll be rewarded. Simple and effective.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Retro Funding is not merely a charitable endeavor; it’s building an impact system where contributions are valued and rewarded.” - <a href=""https://optimism.mirror.xyz/nz5II2tucf3k8tJ76O6HWwvidLB6TLQXszmMnlnhxWU"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">RetroFunding Announcement</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The two biggest  issues with Retro Funding to date are:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>We need orders of magnitude more demand for blockspace as the program is <a href=""https://twitter.com/opmichael_eth/status/1726609910404903240"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">not even close to being sustainable</a> on sequencer revenues alone</li>\n<li>Projects creating the most demand for blockspace have been dramatically under rewarded proportional to their impact due to design decisions made in previous rounds</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>So far, for the most impactful onchain builders, the type we most need to attract and support for Retro Funding to be successful, impact ≠ profit.</strong></p>\n<p>Last round, <a href=""https://twitter.com/carl_cervone/status/1750005488949903817"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">just 5% of the rewards in the went to the top 20% of projects</a> in terms of sequencer fee generation. Straight forks of OS codebases were rewarded at rates comparable to projects with 100x their impact. The message to builders was this: the fastest path to reward is not impact but simply deploying forked OS code. Individuals could make more by launching simple forks or participating in governance than contributing to the most impactful and innovative projects.</p>\n<p>This has created a flywheel working against the intention, as reflected in the fact that OP Mainnet’s ETH-denominated TVL continues to go down 30% YoY. You can see it in that we’ve seen some of the biggest Optimism projects <a href=""https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/2024-05-04-arbitrum-grants-two-million-arb-to-synthetix-for-expansion-and-incentives-7625773760010"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">shift their focus to other ecosystems</a>. Despite multiple large RPGF rounds and considerable business development efforts, there remain such large gaps in builder representation that the hope appears now to be that new chains will pick up the slack from OP Mainnet’s lackluster expansion.</p>\n<p>The fact is that the perception amongst application layer builders, a group woefully underrepresented in the current Badgeholder community as demonstrated by the <a href=""https://twitter.com/carl_cervone/status/1750005488949903817"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">lack of votes for leading OP protocols</a>, that it simply is not designed to reward them, and they’re acting accordingly to determinant of the growth of the Collective.</p>\n<p>This is a recipe for less impact, not more. And less impact means less Retro Funding.</p>\n<p><strong>Many of the design decisions in overhauling this round seem to oriented towards correcting for this, including more focused rounds, data-based voting, and a focus on onchain builders.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“This category will reward onchain builders who contribute to the success of Optimism. This round seeks to expand the reach and impact of the network by rewarding those building across the Superchain, increasing demand for blockspace, and driving value to the Collective. This includes builders who bring new users to the Superchain, drive network effects and protocol usage.” - <a href=""https://optimism.mirror.xyz/nz5II2tucf3k8tJ76O6HWwvidLB6TLQXszmMnlnhxWU"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">RetroFunding Announcement</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The desire with the changes this round seemed oriented toward ensuring that Retro Funding delivered on its core promise of impact = profit to reinvigorate the growth flywheel it is designed to create. The program shift even went so far as to drop the “Public Goods” portion in an attempt to convey that the focus was rewarding a project’s impact regardless of whether it came from original code or copy pasted code, from VC-funded projects or self-bootstrapped projects, from those delivering back to the Collective all of the value they create or privatizing it for a few.</p>\n<p><strong>The message here: we need more impact, and we don’t care what you are or how you get there. Please come create demand for OP Stack blockspace however you see fit, and we’ll reward it.</strong></p>\n<p>In the announcement of the overhaul and its subsequent communication, there was zero indication that certain code repositories would be privileged over others. However, the above post is now suggesting that there is exactly one type of impact that should be excludable: impact that comes from any project with so much as a single line of code that requires any kind of permission to reuse. It is suggested that there are should be no distinctions to be made between a 90% OS project and a 100% OS project, no distinctions to be made between the multitude of different types of licenses and their purposes, that simply if a builder is asking for permission for reusing any portion of their work, their impact may be systematically ignored—and that some builder who forked OS portions of their code should rewarded at 5x the value. <strong>This is frankly shocking and runs against the purpose of Retro Funding.</strong></p>\n<p>This suggestion will likely take us right back to the results of RPGF3, creating the conditions where impact is arbitrarily qualified and simple forks of existing OS codebases, whose code creates no additional value beyond that of the original and whose creators take on little legal or regulatory risk, will have the opportunity to be funded at rates much higher than those creating the most demand for OP Stack blockspace, generating substantial novel OS work, and do so at great personal risk given the profile of their projects.</p>\n<p>It is also confounding as there was no lack of funding for OSS projects in the last round <a href=""https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/CGS5QsqoX9k5_puYopug4SWODm06OAGwOPWiEil2v0U"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">as they represented 80% of the total distribution</a>. The reputational issue we need to fix in this round of Retro Funding is with high impact builders who have largely written off the promise of Retro Funding — OS has been and will continue to be well rewarded.</p>\n<p>Let’s explore some of issues here in more detail.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>OS status alone is a flawed proxy for greater impact</strong></p>\n<p>It is tempting to enable a single filter for what appears on the surface to many Badgeholders—many of whom aren’t familiar with the nuances of different licensing practices—to be unequivocally a desirable things. But in making a design choice to allow voters a one-click exclusion or 5x boost exclusively for OS—and ignore other important characteristics, such as VC funding or open tokenomics—the Collective seems to be implying that 100% OSS is <em><strong>necessarily</strong></em> more impactful than even 99.99% OSS, which is, frankly, indefensible.</p>\n<p><strong>Let’s look at a hypothetical example:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Project A:</strong> Straight fork of OS code from Pancakeswap with $1M in TVL</li>\n<li><strong>Project B:</strong> Sroject combining 90% OS code and 10% non with $700M in TVL</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Under the current proposal, we are suggesting that we should empower Badgeholders to fully exclude Project B to the benefit of Project A, even if an impact measure of Project B is 700x. There is no additional positive externalities created by privileging Project A over Project B. A copy-paste of an existing codebase doesn’t result in larger downstream impact by virtue of it being OS. There is no reason why the impact of Project A should be rewarded over the impact of Project B.</p>\n<p>And, more crucially, enabling this filter means that Badgeholders will <em>never even have the opportunity to observe the enormous disparity in outcomes between the two.</em> There is no way for them to see that there is currently a far more impactful alternative to what they see on the market. They merely shift the weight of the rewards from higher impact to lower impact.</p>\n<p>OSS <em>can</em> create powerful network effects, but it does not always do so in every vertical. And creating binary filters just incentivizes “spray and pray” forking of existing OS software—not innovation or impact—which can have obvious adverse ecosystem consequences extending well beyond a simple misallocation of resources.</p>\n<p><strong>This prioritizes one dimension of a project’s status as a public good, while ignoring others</strong></p>\n<p>Creating a filter that allows for the privileging of impact of one kind of project over another is valid, but focusing it exclusively on the usage rights of code is arbitrary and myopic. <a href=""https://twitter.com/wagmiAlexander/status/1787947341355393323"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Open versus closed is bigger than just whether or not there is a line of code that requires permission to reuse.</a> Projects can be open-source while building eight-figure war chests from private interests. These private interests do not do it out of the goodness of their own hearts, but because they believe that have ways other than code usage to privately extract value from the project or protocol.</p>\n<p>Open token distributions and value accrual mechanisms are just as important in creating positive network effects as open sourcing code but are completely ignored here. No multipliers, no filters exist for other dimensions of openness. Instead, developers are asked that every single line of code they developed can be used freely by every VC who could dedicate millions of dollars to undercutting and destroying their projects while ensuring they get a larger slice of the pie.</p>\n<p>Surely, this is not what Retro Funding is designed to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Optimism itself would be filtered out by the blunt, rushed criteria proposed</strong></p>\n<p>The notion that having even a single repository with some sort of license is enough to label the entire project closed-source is a bar that <a href=""https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs?tab=CC0-1.0-1-ov-file"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">not even Optimism would clear</a>. What this tells me is that adding this filter seems rushed, as confirmed by <a href=""https://twitter.com/JonasSFT/status/1790060054596497450"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Jonas’ own communication</a>.</p>\n<p>And this raises a question: why are we rushing an implementation to create binary filters for OS in a round focused on onchain builders when we haven’t even taken time to assess what exactly here is desirable? If Optimism itself is failing the proposed standard, maybe there’s a need to more fully consider that standard.</p>\n<p><strong>The proposed implementation misses the mark and will cause confusion</strong></p>\n<p>The lack of detail on how specifically this will be implemented is a major cause for concern here, as it will likely allow for proposals to be miscategorized at the voting level and once votes are cast there will be no way to retroactively to reweight or fix anything.</p>\n<p>A review of many of the top prior recipients indicates they have no licenses in place in their repos; are we asking every project applying to Retro Funding to engage lawyers to draw these things up to avoid being filtered? Even the code used to <a href=""https://github.com/voteagora/op-atlas"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">identify which project is OSS</a> is closed source (no license). The Optimism dev console is <a href=""https://github.com/privy-io"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">recommending a bunch of projects</a> that are not open source, in that there’s no code publicly available, but claim to be under an OSI license. Plenty of projects could appear to be OS via their repos but use private proxy or unverified contracts in their actual implementation; there will in effect be no viable way to systematically verify things. Bad actors will game it, and well-meaning badgeholders will never look into it. Once again, impact will be diluted.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In my opinion, the most important thing for Retro Funding to do this cycle is provide a strong signal to application-layer builders that the promise of impact = profit is more than a platitude. It is to make building on the Superchain such a no-brainer that we cannot keep up with the demand of projects flooding out of other ecosystems and into ours with the goal of creating impact. It is to make any shifting of investment to other L2s seem foolhardy. This is how we get new and existing projects to invest in building on the Superchain. Be the best at what you do, work to meet ecosystem demand, and seek impact even if there’s no immediate profit to see from it—because we’ve got you covered.</p>\n<p>Any design or policy choices that could result in complicating the simple and eloquent message that impact = profit on Optimism risks perpetuating the failures of the last round and reinforcing the perceptions among application layer builders that this program is not designed for them. If we do want to go this route, we need to do so extremely carefully and not in a haphazard way.</p>\n<p>My suggestion would be to remove the filters and multipliers from this round and instead use it as an opportunity to test and learn what kind of impact they could have if implemented in future rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Something along the lines of:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include a button to flag a desire to filter non-OS projects this round, but do not let it impact distributions; instead use the data to understand and model the potential impact of the design choice if used in future rounds</li>\n<li>After the round, audit projects labeled as OS using the current methodology, and determine whether this labeling accurately captured truly 100% OS projects or whether the live contracts look different in application and are not truly OS, use this to refine things</li>\n<li>After the round, analyze how many OS projects represent novel interactions versus straight copy-paste jobs—and develop mechanisms to reward progenitors of the original code in these cases so that we actually reward the multiples of impact OS can create</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the mean time, design a round focused exclusively on rewarding OSS. Build in methodology to that round to parse the complexities of license types, find ways to attribute the origin of the codebases to reward their progenitors and contributors not the copiers. Keep the focus on impact = profit, but find ways to measure and reward the network effects of OS independently.</p>'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Retro  Funding 🔴', 'thread_title': 'Retro Funding 4: Onchain Builder - Application Guidelines', 'creation_time': '2024-05-17T15:50:14.372000+00:00', 'username': 'system', 'moderator': True, 'admin': True, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '46.8165.36964'}, page_content='<p><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b81802a94bf723514eb80559771b8a619760688b.jpeg"" data-download-href=""/uploads/short-url/qgzio7G8RAmSRODuOWVk00AR8V5.jpeg?dl=1"" title=""image""><img src=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b81802a94bf723514eb80559771b8a619760688b_2_690x345.jpeg"" alt=""image"" data-base62-sha1=""qgzio7G8RAmSRODuOWVk00AR8V5"" width=""690"" height=""345"" srcset=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b81802a94bf723514eb80559771b8a619760688b_2_690x345.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b81802a94bf723514eb80559771b8a619760688b_2_1035x517.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b81802a94bf723514eb80559771b8a619760688b_2_1380x690.jpeg 2x"" data-dominant-color=""CEB7FC""><div class=""meta""><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#far-image""></use></svg><span class=""filename"">image</span><span class=""informations"">1500×750 149 KB</span><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#discourse-expand""></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<h2><a name=""about-retro-funding-round-4-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#about-retro-funding-round-4-1""></a>About Retro Funding Round 4</h2>\n<p>Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988"">Round 4</a> will allocate 10m OP tokens to reward onchain builders who have deployed contracts to the Superchain and contributed to the success of Optimism.

How does funding public goods drive demand for blockspace in the Optimism ecosystem?,"According to the information provided, funding public goods drives demand for blockspace on Optimism in a few key ways:

1. Funding developer tools, infrastructure, and other public goods makes the Optimism ecosystem easier to build on, learn about, and connect to. This lowers barriers to entry and drives more application development and usage on Optimism, generating increased demand for blockspace.

2. The excerpt states that ""Funding public goods drives growth — and therefore network revenues — from the ground up."" By funding valuable public goods that expand the Optimism ecosystem, it attracts more users, developers, and applications, organically growing the network and its revenues from transaction fees and demand for blockspace.

3. Funding public goods that provide value to builders, users, token holders and the wider Optimism community creates an incentive for these parties to increase their usage and participation on Optimism. More activity translates to greater demand for blockspace.

4. The public goods funding helps make Optimism an attractive and vibrant ecosystem. This virtuous cycle draws in more developers building user-facing applications that require blockspace for transactions.

In essence, strategic funding of public goods that expand the Optimism ecosystem's capabilities and make it more usable is expected to organically drive growth in users, applications, and activity - thereby increasing the demand for the limited blockspace on Optimism over time.",14.037330150604248,"[Document(metadata={'header 2': 'Value from public goods drives demand for blockspace', 'path': 'governance', 'document_name': 'economics.md'}, page_content='Funding public goods drives growth — and therefore network revenues — from the ground up.\nIn our [first round](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/11/16/retro1.html) of RetroPGF, Optimism funded a set of hugely valuable developer tools and core infrastructure.\nThe aggregate effect is an ecosystem that is easier to build on, learn about, and connect to, in turn driving application usage and generating more demand for blockspace.  \nBut what value do these public goods provide, and for whom is it valuable?\nThis is a rich design space.\nOptimism’s governance is designed to create conditions for experimentation around this question.\nThe Foundation draws heavily on the work of Ostrom, Vitalik, and others to make sure funding for public goods is maximally efficient, effective, and safe.  \nTo start, Foundation governance is shared and divided through a two-house system, where network parameters for the amount of funding are controlled by both houses, but the governance of RetroPGF allocation is determined by a set of Citizens with local knowledge and skin in the game.  \nThoughtful allocation of public goods funding will create longterm value for builders, users, tokenholders, citizens and the entire Optimism Collective.'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'ARCHIVED  & OLD Missions', 'thread_title': '[Draft][GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Paparuda', 'creation_time': '2022-10-13T10:23:23.954000+00:00', 'username': 'alexczet', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 1, 'id': '63.3677.14761'}, page_content='<p>There are two responses to this</p>\n<p>1/Larger externalities : if we take the concept of “public goods” to mean something beyond the blockchain ecosystem, we can see the idea of doing good as a general positive for humanity, and if this efforts emanates from a project running on Optimism, it directly ties optimism to this effort.

So for me opensource software is “the” public good. It’s the very definition of public good. There is other stuff that can be considered public goods but it’s really hard to define and can be challenged so when I think of public goods I think of opensource software.

How does one progress through the ambassador roles in Optimism Governance?,"According to the Optimism documentation on Ambassador Requirements, there is a progression path to become an Optimism Ambassador:

1. `wannabe-ambassador` role
   - To show interest, get the `wannabe-ambassador` role in the #become-an-ambassador Discord channel
   - Get up to speed by reading pinned messages and reviewing Reddit posts
   - Stay active on Reddit r/optimismCollective by answering questions, upvoting, commenting (spamming or low quality activity won't be viewed favorably)

2. `ambassador-in-training` role
   - The requirements to progress to this role are not explicitly stated, but active participation on Reddit seems to be a key factor that peers will evaluate.

3. `ambassador` role
   - The final ambassador role is achieved after successfully completing the training phase as an `ambassador-in-training`.

The key points are:

- Show interest by getting the `wannabe-ambassador` role on Discord
- Stay active on the Optimism community channels, especially Reddit
- Create high-quality, values-focused content 
- Collaborate with and help others grow in the program
- Peers will evaluate your activity and contributions to determine progression

How does the Citizens' House contribute to the governance of the Optimism Collective?,"According to the information provided, the Citizens' House plays an important role in the governance of the Optimism Collective alongside the Token House. Here are some key points about how the Citizens' House contributes:

1. The Citizens' House is responsible for voting on the allocation of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) to projects that have provided public goods to the Optimism ecosystem. This allows the Citizens to directly fund and incentivize work that benefits the collective.

2. In the future, the role of the Citizens' House will expand beyond just RetroPGF. It will work jointly with the Token House on things like allocating surplus protocol revenue, determining criteria for Citizenship eligibility, and providing checks and balances on the Token House.

3. The Citizens' House uses a one-person-one-vote system, in contrast to the Token House which is based on OP token holdings. This gives individual human stakeholders like builders, users and community members an equal voice in governance decisions impacting the long-term interests of Optimism.

4. Certain governance powers require approval from both Houses. For example, the Token House drives protocol upgrade proposals but the Citizens' House has veto power over them as a check against capture of the Token House.

5. The Citizens' House is meant to represent and prioritize the long-term growth and sustainability of the Optimism Collective, complementing the more economically-driven incentives of the Token House.

So in essence, the Citizens' House contributes a critical voice for the individual human stakeholders of Optimism and provides balance to the token-weighted governance of the Token House, especially for decisions around public goods funding and long-term sustainability.",14.853923797607422,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'General  Discussions ✨ ', 'thread_title': 'Delegate or Citizen?', 'creation_time': '2024-04-08T15:24:36.701000+00:00', 'username': '0xDonPepe', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '1.7949.35733'}, page_content='<blockquote>\n<p>The Optimism Collective is governed by two houses, the Token House and the Citizens’ House.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the Token House, OP holders are responsible for submitting, deliberating, and voting on various types of Optimism Collective governance proposals.

The Token House is made up of OP holders and their delegates, and the Citizens’ House is a one-person-one-vote system based on reputation.</p>\n<p>This two-house design is intended to help the Collective make good decisions and avoid common pitfalls in token-based governance systems. Tokenholders represent one constituency out of many, and are not always the right unilateral owners for decisions that don’t involve the economics of the system. Creating two distinct branches of governance with different membership criteria allows the Collective to match constituents’ incentives with different types of decisions. It also helps the Collective avoid concentration of power, enact safeguards via checks and balances, and evaluate decisions from broader perspectives.</p>\n<p>This is not a new concept. Bi- or tri-cameral governance systems have existed for centuries. With a new iteration of a known pattern, Optimism aims to build a governance system that will stand the test of time and help the Collective flourish.</p>\n<p>This post provides an overview of the goals, design principles, and problem spaces of Optimism Governance. It is not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance processes will be introduced and implemented: it’s highly likely the Collective will learn from initial experiments and make modifications to the rules and processes outlined here. These “Problem Spaces” are intended as starting points for discussion.</p>\n<h2><a name=""governance-goals-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#governance-goals-2""></a>Governance Goals</h2>\n<p>There are two primary goals of Optimism’s governance system:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Capture resistance.</strong> Governance plays a key role in securing the anti-capture and censorship resistance of the Optimism protocol. Governance should (a) make it possible for chain or network operation to continue without reliance on any individual entity, and (b) prevent any one entity or small group of entities from being able to control or censor the protocol or its functions.</li>\n<li><strong>Resource allocation.</strong> Governance’s second primary responsibility is to allocate resources effectively to support the Collective’s vision and accrue sustainable value to the Optimism Collective. Vision &amp; value may often be in conflict, and allocating resources effectively involves a blend of short- and long-term thinking. This includes allocation of both the token treasury and protocol revenue.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=""design-principles-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#design-principles-3""></a>Design Principles</h2>\n<p>Design decisions for the Collective’s governance system should be made in line with three key principles:</p>\n<p><strong>Governance minimization</strong>. The set of governance responsibilities that are encoded onchain or formalized in voting processes should remain as minimal as possible. The Collective aims to reduce governance to its essence and to avoid introducing regulation where freedom can achieve the same result. This principle is key to encouraging permissionless innovation. In practice, this looks like a minimal set of (1) onchain governance processes to upgrade Optimism contracts and tune the economic parameters of the system, and (2) offchain social processes to maintain a healthy community.</p>\n<p><strong>Iteration</strong>. Optimism is decentralizing iteratively to increase the chances of building a healthy system that lasts for the long-term. This means the Foundation will play a role in establishing processes, help the Collective through its first few rapid feedback loops in improving those processes, then reduce its role over time. (This also means the design principles and goals outlined in this document may be invalidated or updated along the way.) This iteration gives the Collective a chance to learn how to make thoughtful decisions using an un-intuitive but essential loop: introduce a governance process that involves active participation, then gradually work to automate or minimize it over time. Governance’s responsibility then becomes to adjust the autopilot when necessary, not to keep two hands on the wheel.</p>\n<p><strong>Forking</strong>. The right to fork and the right to exit are critical to protect individual freedoms. All of the core software and tooling required to run the Optimism network should be made open source, freely available, and easy to use such that a fork is always a viable alternative. This isn’t just about vibes: in crypto, where credible commitments not to extract are <a href=""https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/when-is-decentralizing-on-a-blockchain-valuable/"">what makes decentralized platforms valuable</a>, this is a competitive advantage. Participants will be more likely to join Optimism if they have the ability to make an alternative.</p>\n<p><strong>Balance</strong>. Influence in governance must extend beyond financial stake to value humanhood and intelligent life. The centralizing force of plutocratic token governance must be balanced with Citizenship. Giving voice and power to different constituents allows the Collective to match decisions with voters’ incentives, rather than building a solely plutocratic system. Checks and balances prevent capture.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact = profit.</strong> A key part of the Optimistic Vision is to ensure that every individual is rewarded in proportion to their positive impact to the Collective. We believe this to be the most important target in the pursuit of solving global coordination problems and creating a better future. Our economy is an expression of our collective needs, wants, and ethics. Optimism Governance is ultimately responsible for enacting this fairness ratio that is key to the Optimistic Vision.</p>\n<h2><a name=""design-overview-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#design-overview-4""></a>Design Overview</h2>\n<p>The responsibilities of Optimism Governance can be categorized into one of the two primary goals of the governance system: <strong>Capture Resistance</strong> and <strong>Resource Allocation</strong>. Within each category, governance responsibilities are identified as (a) the exclusive responsibility of one or the other house, (b) a responsibility where one house drives proposals and the other house may veto, or (c) as a truly shared responsibility subject to approval by each house. This system is designed to help each house play to its strengths and avoid deadlock.</p>\n<p>The Optimism <strong>Token House</strong> is made up of OP tokenholders and their delegates. Tokenholders and their delegates are expected to be rational economic actors interested in preserving or increasing the economic well-being of the Optimism Collective. Therefore, the Token House is responsible for decisions that affect business parameters of the system such as inflation or the variables that govern sequencer selection. Token voting is distributed widely and permissionlessly and helps represent the free market in the Collective’s decision making.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the Token House, the <strong>Citizens’ House</strong> uses a one-person, one-vote system. Citizens are meant to represent individual human stakeholders of the Collective: builders, users, and community members who are aligned with the project’s values and are interested in the long-term benefit of the Collective. Therefore, the Citizens’ House is responsible for decisions that may require prioritizing long term growth ahead of other goals – decisions like allocating funding to public goods that support the Collective. In the long term, we can expect the Citizens’ House to expand to include the thousands or millions or billions of humans interacting with Optimism.</p>\n<p>Governance responsibilities given to each house will change over time as the Collective iterates towards its long-term governance-minimized end state. This includes introducing highly manual governance responsibilities (e.g. inflation adjustments, or Superchain allowlists) that are intended to be replaced by automated smart defaults as the Collective learns how to govern these vectors appropriately. It may also include transitioning powers from the responsibility of the full governance body to a subset of governance participants who are empowered by their broader governance base.</p>\n<p>In these early chapters of Collective governance, many of these iterations have been designed or implemented by the Optimism Foundation. Eventually this must transition to the responsibility of Collective governance itself. This meta-governance power marks the end of the Foundation’s stewardship of the evolution of Collective governance and entrusts the governance community with continued experimentation towards a healthy end-state for Optimism.</p>\n<p>So: what does governance… well, govern?</p>\n<h2><a name=""problem-space-1-capture-resistance-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#problem-space-1-capture-resistance-5""></a><strong>Problem Space <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#1:</span> Capture Resistance</strong></h2>\n<p>Optimism Governance’s first responsibility is to ensure that no single party can unilaterally control, censor, halt, or otherwise extract rent from Optimism. A decentralized compute layer is hardly valuable if controlled by a centralized entity. Governance helps the Collective make decisions in the absence of any one person or organization that is “in charge.”</p>\n<p>The responsibility to uphold capture resistance can be broken down into two broad categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>hard powers:</strong> governance powers that are eventually encoded and executed onchain, and</li>\n<li><strong>soft powers:</strong> social norms the governance community upholds, not enforced onchain but by the community’s ability to fork.<br>\n<br></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>1/ Hard powers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Protocol Upgrades</strong> refer to the ability for governance to make changes to the OP Stack protocol itself. This is a crucial responsibility of governance that ultimately makes the community the steward of Optimism’s core protocol functionality.</p>\n<p>Protocol upgrades will be approved by the Token House, subject to a Citizens’ House veto. The Token House is the primary approver because of its broad reach and likelihood of representing business interests that depend on the OP Stack’s functionality. The Citizens’ House veto power guards against capture of the Token House and increases the resilience of the overall system.</p>\n<p>Today, protocol upgrades are approved by the Token House and executed manually by the Optimism Foundation. In the coming Seasons, the Collective may implement a Security Council responsible for executing upgrades following the will of governance. The Citizens’ House veto power comes online in Season 5 (H1 2023), when the Citizens’ House comes fully online. Eventually, execution of protocol upgrades will be fully onchain. On a far enough time horizon, we can expect protocol upgrades to become less and less common as the protocol nears feature completeness. We can look to protocols like Ethereum and Bitcoin as a model for what mature decentralized protocol upgrades look like.</p>\n<p><strong>Sequencer Selection</strong> is the ability to make choices about which parties may act as sequencers for OP Chains or in shared sequencing schemes.</p>\n<p>This begins as an explicit governance power driven by the Token House, with Citizens’ House power to veto. Sequencers are important economic actors for OP Chains and eventually for the Superchain. The Token House is well-incentivized to make sure sequencer selection is fair and beneficial for the Collective. The Citizens’ House veto power guards against the capture of the Token House related to sequencer selection.</p>\n<p>Today, OP Chains are sequenced by a handful of different entities. In Season 5, those sequencers will submit proposals to Optimism Governance to be formally included in the Superchain, officially bringing the hard power of sequencer selection into the hands of the Collective. More information about this governance process will be shared in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Eventually, sequencer selection may be fully automated based on verifiable and pre-agreed upon processes, enabling the sequencer set to be curated and maintained without active governance intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Citizenship Eligibility</strong> is the responsibility of governance to select new humans to participate in the Citizens’ House of Optimism Governance.</p>\n<p>Citizenship Eligibility will be determined by the Citizens’ House; the Token House will have the power to veto. Assuming good long-term values alignment with the Collective, Citizens should be incentivized to grow a set of voters that make quality decisions about RetroPGF allocations. A Token House veto guards against capture of the Citizens’ House or moves to consolidate power.</p>\n<p>To date, Citizenship expansion has been administered by the Foundation. In the future, the Foundation will propose an expansion algorithm that Citizens vote to approve. Ultimately, Citizens may govern a citizenship selection algorithm directly that runs across identity data in the Optimism AttestationStation. In its final minimized form, the Citizens’ House has established a battle-tested onchain selection process; updates to the contracts that govern selection can be made as necessary by the Citizens’ House.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>2/ Soft powers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Code of Conduct Enforcement</strong> is the responsibility of governance to uphold and enforce the Optimism Collective Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>Each house may govern the code of conduct for its own members. The best cultural and values-based enforcement for governance communities should come from within that specific community.</p>\n<p>Today, CoC violations are processed with administration from the Foundation. In future Seasons, the community will iterate on this approach: Season 4 includes an <a href=""https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2"">RFP for Code of Conduct research</a>, and Season 6 may introduce a new Council to replace the Foundation’s role in this process. As a soft power, Code of Conduct enforcement will not be implemented onchain. For example, if a Token House delegate were to violate the Code of Conduct, that delegate would not be prevented from voting by an update to Optimism’s voting contracts onchain. Rather, the community could enforce its rules and norms on the social layer by choosing to remove the participant from delegation frontends and UIs, or by informing the tokenholders who’ve delegated to the offending party of the breach in conduct.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Removal</strong> is the right of governance to remove a director of the Optimism Foundation. Director Removals are approved by the Token House.</p>\n<p>This right is enforced and upheld by the Founding Documents of the Optimism Collective. As such, the Token House may vote to veto any reduction of this power. As Directors are not represented onchain, this responsibility does not have onchain enforceability.</p>\n<h2><a name=""problem-space-2-resource-allocation-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#problem-space-2-resource-allocation-6""></a><strong>Problem Space <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#2:</span> Resource Allocation</strong></h2>\n<p>The second primary responsibility of Optimism governance is to allocate the Collective’s resources to help it achieve its goals. This is a piece of essential governance that requires human intervention, especially in its early stages. Resource allocation in the Collective comes in three forms:</p>\n<p><strong>1/ Allocation of Protocol Revenue</strong><br>\n<strong>2/ OP Treasury Management</strong><br>\n<strong>3/ RetroPGF Funding</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Allocation of Protocol Revenue</strong> is the responsibility of governance to determine how to direct surplus ETH generated by the Optimism protocol. Optimism generates revenue through transaction fees paid on OP Mainnet and other OP Chains. Part of these transaction fees is used to post data to Ethereum L1 and pay for other expenses associated with running the protocol, and the remainder of the fee is accumulated as surplus revenue that can be directed by the Collective for the benefit of the Collective. In the future, the sequencing and proving networks that help run the Optimism protocol may also provide sources of revenue for the Collective.</p>\n<p>By default, surplus protocol revenue will be allocated to RetroPGF. The Token House may vote on proposals to divert a portion of the surplus protocol revenue for other Optimism Collective purposes as they see fit. These proposals will be subject to veto right by the Citizens’ House.</p>\n<p>Protocol Revenue is a crucial lever in the Collective. In its early stages, the default allocation to RetroPGF lets the Collective reward projects that grow the Optimism ecosystem. As Optimism matures, the Token House is entrusted to propose deviations from this default for the health of the Optimism Collective. Citizens’ House veto powers help hold the Token House accountable and prevent short term optimization at the expense of long term sustainability.</p>\n<p>In a future governance season, a proposal type will be introduced for proposing modifications to the allocation of surplus protocol revenue. These proposals may begin with certain safeguards, like a cap on possible allocations. Proposal power for high-level budgeting decisions may additionally be delegated to elected representatives as the Token House sees fit. The long term minimized state of this governance responsibility could include some thoughtful automation to determine revenue allocations based on indicators of whether the Collective should be in a “growth” stage or “value” stage.</p>\n<p><strong>OP Treasury Allocation</strong> is the responsibility of governance to direct how the existing OP token treasury is allocated. This has several components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <strong>Governance Fund</strong>, which is directed by Token House governance.</li>\n<li>The <strong>RetroPGF Fund</strong>, which is directed by Citizens’ House governance, subject to a Token House veto.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Seed Fund</strong> and <strong>Unallocated</strong> portions of the token treasury, which are initially administered by the Foundation, and will eventually be directed jointly by both houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Foundation Budget Approvals</strong>, which are governed jointly by both houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Inflation adjustments</strong>, which are governed by the Token House, subject to a Citizens’ House veto.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This distributed ownership of the OP Treasury allows for flexibility and gives each house a clear mechanism to allocate tokens for the development of the Collective. Today, treasury allocations are administered by the Foundation, and will gradually move onchain as the governance system matures and becomes more resilient. In the long term, as most of the Treasury is circulating, this power will boil down to the governance of inflation, which can be automated to a thoughtful set of defaults based on the economic health of the Collective.</p>\n<p><strong>RetroPGF Grants</strong> are the responsibility of governance to allocate RetroPGF to projects that have provided public good to the Optimism Collective. These grants may refer to either (a) OP tokens from the RetroPGF Fund portion of the token treasury (see OP Treasury Allocation), or (b) Profits generated by the Optimism Protocol that governance has decided to allocate to RetroPGF (see Allocation of Protocol Revenue). Specifically, this responsibility includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>RetroPGF Scope</strong>: the ability of governance to update the scope, metrics, and impact evaluation criteria used in determining how RetroPGF Grants are allocated to projects. In line with the principle of governance minimization, this should be a soft power.</li>\n<li><strong>Project Allocations</strong>: the ability of the Citizens’ House to make specific individual project-level decisions about how the RetroPGF Scope is applied to allocate grants. This is the corresponding hard power for RetroPGF.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both components of RetroPGF Grants above are the responsibility of the Citizens’ House. Citizens are selected as individual humans who are interested in the long term health of the Optimism Collective, and RetroPGF is a long term investment in Optimism’s growth.</p>\n<p>Today, the Foundation identifies RetroPGF scope and Citizens make Project Allocation decisions. Eventually, Citizens will govern RetroPGF scope themselves.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Altogether, this looks like the diagram below:</p>\n<p><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339.png"" data-download-href=""/uploads/short-url/caEzKbwfX1MMuFTjinRTEdM3vVD.png?dl=1"" title=""""><img src=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_690x345.png"" alt="""" data-base62-sha1=""caEzKbwfX1MMuFTjinRTEdM3vVD"" width=""690"" height=""345"" role=""presentation"" srcset=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_690x345.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_1035x517.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_1380x690.png 2x"" data-dominant-color=""23212B""><div class=""meta""><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#far-image""></use></svg><span class=""filename""></span><span class=""informations"">3840×1921 572 KB</span><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#discourse-expand""></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<h2><a name=""additional-notes-7"" class=""anchor"" href=""#additional-notes-7""></a>Additional Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Incompleteness</strong></p>\n<p>The list above does not include all governance powers – it notably excludes governance responsibilities, especially social ones.</p>\n<p>The list above is also not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance powers will be rolled out and implemented.

In particular, it’s important to note that all veto powers are not created equal. A very high veto threshold and quorum create a higher bar for exercising veto power, where a simple majority could make for a relatively easy veto. These thresholds determine the balance of power in responsibilities shared between houses and must be considered carefully.</p>\n<p>The Collective will apply the principle of iteration in introducing these checks, balances, and vetos. This allows time to experiment with the right settings and make sure both branches of governance are developing safely.</p>\n<p>These details are incredibly important to the design of a well-functioning system, and members of the Collective are consulting with a set of experts, from crypto and beyond, to design a quality set of patterns to increase the chances of Optimism Governance’s success. If you’re interested in contributing to these efforts, you’re welcome to reach out to <a href=""http://mailto:bobby@optimism.io/"">bobby@optimism.io</a> or chime in on the governance forums.</p>\n<p><strong>Citizenship and capture</strong></p>\n<p>Since Citizens play a crucial role in the Optimism governance, it’s paramount that the Citizens’ House is qualified and capture-resistant. Several factors come into play here, including the ways identity and contribution history can help inform citizenship eligibility; public and private voting strategies to help prevent collusion and bribery; citizenship incentives; escape hatches and metagovernance in the event of capture; and the iterative path towards growing the set of Citizens and their responsibilities. These important topics will be discussed in greater detail in a future post.</p>\n<h1><a name=""key-milestones-8"" class=""anchor"" href=""#key-milestones-8""></a>Key Milestones</h1>\n<p>Optimism Governance continues to make steady strides towards a robust and sustainable system.

How does the Impact Evaluation Framework assist badgeholders in reviewing RetroPGF applications?,"The Impact Evaluation Framework is designed to assist badgeholders in reviewing and evaluating RetroPGF applications by providing clear definitions, relevant stakeholders/audiences, important terms, and measurable metrics for each impact category.

Specifically, the framework offers the following for each impact category:

1. Definition of the category and what constitutes impact within that category.

2. Identification of relevant stakeholders and audiences whose impact should be considered for that category.

3. Explanation of important terms and concepts related to that impact category.

4. Suggested quantitative and qualitative metrics that can be used to measure and evaluate the impact claimed by projects in that category.

By outlining these elements, the Impact Evaluation Framework aims to give badgeholders a structured way to understand and assess the different types of impact a project may claim.

How does the OP Passport project enhance privacy and security for governance participants?,"The OP Passport project aims to enhance privacy and security for governance participants in a few key ways:

1. Anonymous Attestations using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP):
   - It allows users to provide on-chain attestations or endorsements without revealing their identity, while still maintaining the validity and integrity of the attestation.
   - This is achieved through the use of ZKP technology, where users can generate a cryptographic proof that verifies their identity role (e.g. delegate, delegator, etc.) without disclosing their actual identity.

2. Digital Identity Passports:
   - Users can create and manage their on-chain digital identity passports to track their governance participation, roles, and achievements.
   - This provides a secure and verifiable way to build reputation within the Optimism governance ecosystem without compromising privacy.

3. Smart Account Wallets:
   - The project utilizes smart contract wallets (e.g. Safe by Gnosis) as comprehensive repositories to store users' identity passports and related attestations.
   - Smart contract wallets enhance security by removing the need to manage private keys directly and enabling features like multi-signature authorization.

4. Selective Disclosure:
   - While anonymous attestations hide the attester's identity, the attested party's role (delegate, delegator, etc.) is still publicly visible, allowing for transparency.
   - This balanced approach enables privacy while maintaining accountability within the governance process.

In summary, the OP Passport leverages cutting-edge cryptographic techniques like ZKPs and smart contract wallets to provide governance participants with enhanced privacy controls and a secure on-chain identity layer, fostering trust and active participation in the Optimism governance process.",15.767593145370483,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'General  Discussions ✨ ', 'thread_title': 'OP Passport | Design Document', 'creation_time': '2024-06-07T09:23:44.726000+00:00', 'username': 'v3naru_Curia', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '1.8275.37574'}, page_content='<p>I am excited to share with the new project we are working on called <strong>OP Passport</strong>.

How does the Optimism Collective generate value for its ecosystem?,"According to the Optimism documentation on OP Economics, the Optimism Collective is designed to generate value for three main constituencies in its ecosystem:

1. Value for tokenholders: This is achieved through the productive re-deployment of sequencer revenue. The sequencer revenue is primarily directed to fund public goods, which creates ecosystem value and drives demand for blockspace on Optimism.

2. Value for contributors and builders: Value accrues directly to contributors and builders through retroactive public goods funding enabled by the OP token. Additionally, builders benefit from having a thriving ecosystem with well-funded tools, education, apps, and infrastructure to build upon.

3. Value for users and community members: Users and community members gain value through ongoing airdrops of the OP token, project incentives made possible by ecosystem funding, and the benefits provided by the public goods funded by the Collective.

In essence, it forms a virtuous cycle where sequencer revenue funds public goods development, which increases the value of the Optimism ecosystem, driving further demand for blockspace and sequencer revenue to continue fueling this cycle. The key pillars are funding public goods, incentivizing contributors/builders, and rewarding users/community members - all aimed at fostering a thriving and valuable Optimism ecosystem.",13.865180253982544,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'General  Discussions ✨ ', 'thread_title': 'OP as an MEV staking token', 'creation_time': '2022-08-02T09:31:39.272000+00:00', 'username': 'diligit', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '1.3202.11346'}, page_content='<p>Create, develop, contribute to the Optimism Ecosystem, that’s how value is formed.

How does the Optimism Collective plan to align the community in Season 4?,"According to the information provided, the Optimism Collective plans to align the community in Season 4 through the introduction of several new foundational concepts:

1. Collective Intents: These are directional goals that allow the entire Collective to align and focus their efforts. All work supported or executed by the Collective should be in pursuit of the defined Collective Intents. The Token House will vote to approve budgets for each proposed Intent.

2. Missions: These are specific initiatives that work towards achieving a Collective Intent. There are two types:
   a) Proposed Missions submitted by community members and approved by the Token House to receive funding from the Governance Fund.
   b) Foundation Missions defined by the Optimism Foundation, akin to public Requests for Proposals funded by the Partner Fund.

3. Alliances: Groups of contributors that temporarily come together to execute a Mission from start to finish.

4. Collective Trust Tiers: A reputation system where one's positive impact in the ecosystem creates additional opportunities. Alliances can submit Mission proposals based on their Trust Tier level.

By introducing these aligned concepts of Intents, Missions, Alliances and Trust Tiers, the Optimism Collective aims to coordinate the entire community to work towards common strategic goals in a more structured and incentivized manner during Season 4.",15.2969810962677,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Delegates  🏛', 'thread_title': 'Guide to Season 5', 'creation_time': '2023-12-13T07:31:40.932000+00:00', 'username': 'Vincent_APACDAO', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 1, 'id': '41.6894.31694'}, page_content='<p>Hi, would be great if the Optimism community can have more details about the Guide to Season 5 covering the matters below.</p>\n<p>(1) The concepts like Intents, Trust Tiers, Missions, Alliances, and Attestations in particular for Intents the reasons why each Intent is crucial for the Collective’s growth and decentralization whereas for Trust Tiers the manner in which adjustments would be made based on delegates’ feedback.</p>\n<p>(2) The roles and responsibilities of the introduced governance structures and the manner in which they interact with and complement each other.</p>\n<p>(3) The significance of the Intent Setting Workshop and how the community’s involvement in the Workshop will shape the direction of Season 5.</p>\n<p>(4) The functions of the Code of Conduct Councils in streamlining the enforcement process and the importance of this in supporting the community’s role in the Collective’s success.</p>\n<p>(5) The rationale for the timeline such as for example, the reasons there a longer break between December 22nd and January 4th.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to some information on the above.</p>\n<p>Cheers.</p>'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Delegates  🏛', 'thread_title': 'Guide to Season 4: As a Collective', 'creation_time': '2023-04-27T03:23:33.176000+00:00', 'username': 'Joxes', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '41.5886.25606'}, page_content='<h3><a name=""our-first-wave-of-feedback-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#our-first-wave-of-feedback-1""></a>Our first wave of feedback</h3>\n<p>Hi community and governance members, from our side we are excited about this clear change in methodology for Season 4 to cover different objectives and ensure that they are met with a more thorough system. Iterating on the governance of Optimism has always been a priority, and we agree that this is one way we can make this upcoming season different.

The Collective is a band of communities, companies, and citizens united by a mutually beneficial pact to adhere to the axiom of <strong>impact=profit</strong> — the principle that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual. This axiom serves as a North Star, motivating the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We leave below our first feedback on the proposals discussed for season 4:</p>\n<aside class=""quote quote-modified"" data-post=""16"" data-topic=""5874"">\n  <div class=""title"">\n    <div class=""quote-controls""></div>\n    <img loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""24"" height=""24"" src=""https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/joxes/48/5814_2.png"" class=""avatar"">\n    <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874/16"">[OLD] Collective Intents: Season 4</a> <a class=""badge-category__wrapper "" href=""/c/governance/41""><span data-category-id=""41"" data-drop-close=""true"" class=""badge-category "" title=""Information on voting cycles, rules &amp; processes, delegation, and the grants program""><span class=""badge-category__name"">🏛 Token House Governance</span></span></a>\n  </div>\n  <blockquote>\n    After reading the Collective Intents initiative, we want to provide our first feedback on the four proposed items, and share some first thoughts: \n\n<a name=""intent-1-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#intent-1-1""></a>Intent 1\nThis is one of the most interesting and necessary paths for Optimism to mature as a protocol.

How does the Optimism Collective plan to fund public goods?,"According to the information provided, the Optimism Collective plans to fund public goods through a process called Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) or Retro Funding. Here are the key points:

1. The profits generated by the Optimism sequencer (the node that produces blocks on Optimism) will be allocated to funding public goods that benefit the Optimism ecosystem, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole.

2. There will be recurring rounds of Retro Funding where projects and contributions that qualify as public goods can receive retroactive funding rewards. 

3. The governance of allocating the Retro Funding rewards will be determined by a group called the Citizens' House, which aims to have one human representing each Citizen.

4. The Citizens' House will research and make informed decisions on which nominated public goods projects should receive funding rewards from the allocated pool.

5. This funding mechanism is designed to incentivize and sustain the creation of valuable open-source tools, infrastructure and other public goods that drive growth and usage of the Optimism network.

6. Over time, the Optimism governance will transition to having the Citizens' House take full autonomy in proposing the scope, sizing and parameters around Retro Funding rounds for public goods.

So in essence, sequencer profits fund a pool for retroactively rewarding impactful public goods contributions, as decided by a representative group of Citizens incentivized to grow the overall ecosystem.",14.270179748535156,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Get  Started 🌱', 'thread_title': 'Working Constitution of the Optimism Collective', 'creation_time': '2022-06-08T13:54:24.971000+00:00', 'username': 'vonnie610', 'moderator': True, 'admin': True, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '67.55.7019'}, page_content='<p>Hello!

It is very important that one Citizen is one human, which is why there is so much discussion about identity solutions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What are the mutual rights and obligations of citizens, boards, members of the community?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are a few questions rolled up here, so I am only going to answer about the Citizens. The rights and obligations of Citizens is to distribute funding to public goods. This will include researching nominated projects to make informed decisions, much like the delegates.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What are the mechanisms to overcome plutocracy?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Citizens are not using tokens to vote (which can be bought). Instead each Citizen represents one human, as such rights to Citizenship cannot be bought. This of course does not prevent bribery of the person, but there are structures that can be put in place to minimise this risk and increase the “cost” of accepting bribes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How will the community generate social value, benefit, how to make a profit?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again there are a few questions here, but the main point is, what is paying for public goods?

How does the Optimism Collective plan to handle identity and reputation?,"Based on the information provided, the Optimism Collective plans to handle identity and reputation in the following ways:

1. Robust user and project identity is seen as a foundation for Citizenship within the Optimism Collective. This will improve the quality of governance, support developers building on Optimism, and create a high-trust ecosystem.

2. They want to avoid pitfalls like products that don't solve real problems, attestations that aren't consumed for a use case, chicken-and-egg issues with bootstrapping an identity network, overly top-down criteria for citizenship, and arbitrary attestations.

3. Decentralized identity solutions that allow users to prove attributes about themselves in a trustworthy way without compromising privacy are central to Optimism's mission of enabling positive-sum games and democratic governance.

4. For the Citizens' House governance, they plan to use a one-person-one-vote system based on reputation and community contributions, rather than token holdings.

5. They are exploring using attestations and a points-based system that combines different signals like forum presence, Twitter, project attestations, attending events etc. to establish credibility and reputation for citizenship eligibility.

6. Specific proposals have passed to gather relevant reputation attributes via attestations to support future citizenship selection criteria.

7. There is ongoing discussion among badge holders and the community on what reputation attributes/attestations could be valuable signals for future citizenship selection.

How does the Pairwise voting system work in the context of RetroPGF?,"Based on the information provided, the Pairwise voting system was proposed as a potential tool to assist badgeholders in the RetroPGF voting process, but it will not be directly integrated into the official RetroPGF 3 voting system this fall.

The key points about Pairwise and its role in RetroPGF are:

1. Pairwise is described as a ""Tinder UX for web3 community signaling"" that aims to provide a user-friendly interface for badgeholders to evaluate and vote on projects.

2. For RetroPGF 3, Pairwise will not be able to automatically submit votes into the official RetroPGF voting system, as that protocol is not yet open.

3. However, the Optimism Foundation is enthusiastic about Pairwise playing a role in RetroPGF 3 as an experiment around voting UI/UX and as a source of voter feedback.

4. Badgeholders will be able to use Pairwise as a voting assistance tool to help them make decisions. The Foundation plans to provide an ""import"" functionality so ballots created in Pairwise can be easily ported into the official voting tool.

5. Going forward after RetroPGF 3, the goal is to make the voting protocol open so alternate designs like Pairwise can directly integrate with the RetroPGF process.

So in summary, while not officially integrated yet, Pairwise aims to provide an alternative user-friendly interface for badgeholders to evaluate projects and prepare their ballots, which can then be imported into the main voting system for RetroPGF 3.",12.057092666625977,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Retro  Funding 🔴', 'thread_title': 'RetroPGF 3: Round Design', 'creation_time': '2023-12-13T07:01:39.520000+00:00', 'username': 'Vincent_APACDAO', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 1, 'id': '46.6802.31692'}, page_content='<p>Hi, would be great if the Optimism community can have more details about the RetroPGF 3; Round Design covering the matters below.</p>\n<p>(1)  The concept of public goods funding its significance to the Optimism ecosystem.</p>\n<p>(2)  The learning objectives for RetroPGF 3 particularly the specific aims to be achieved through this round and how it builds on the lessons learned from the previous rounds.</p>\n<p>(3) The specific metrics or benchmarks to measure the success of the improvements such as what are the measurement metrics “better data quality” whether in terms of data accuracy or completeness etc.</p>\n<p>(4) Some hypothetical scenarios or case studies to illustrate how badgeholders can use Lists effectively to help them visualize the practical application of this new tool.</p>\n<p>(5) The steps to actively participate and contribute to the ongoing development of the system whether it’s signing up, providing feedback, or participating in the RetroPGF initiative.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to some information on the above.</p>\n<p>Cheers.</p>'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Retro  Funding 🔴', 'thread_title': 'RetroPGF Experimentation: Voting Algorithms', 'creation_time': '2023-12-08T11:14:20.718000+00:00', 'username': 'Jonas', 'moderator': True, 'admin': False, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '46.7216.31604'}, page_content='<p>We’re on a journey of exploring which voting algorithm is optimal to achieve the goals of RetroPGF.<br>\nThis is an invite for an open discussion of what voting algorithms should be considered and their advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<h3><a name=""a-brief-history-of-retropgf-voting-algorithms-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#a-brief-history-of-retropgf-voting-algorithms-1""></a>A brief history of RetroPGF voting algorithms</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=""https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/11/16/retro1.html""><strong>RetroPGF 1</strong></a>: Quadratic Voting (sum of square root of x sub i, for all i)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=""https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/retropgf-2/#""><strong>RetroPGF 2</strong></a></strong>: Simple Average</li>\n<li><a href=""https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/retropgf-3/""><strong>RetroPGF 3</strong></a>: Median with simple quorum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Voting algorithm for RetroPGF 3 will not be changed.<br>\nAnonymised voting data from Round 3 will give us a great opportunity to test how different voting algos would impact result!</p>'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Retro  Funding 🔴', 'thread_title': 'Grants for Building RetroPGF tools', 'creation_time': '2023-08-07T16:57:01.372000+00:00', 'username': 'connor', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 1, 'id': '46.6591.28745'}, page_content='<p>Hello Optimists!</p>\n<p>I’m very excited about the RetroPGF experiment that Optimism has been running, and I’m a frequent lurker in the forums and retrospectives on each round.</p>\n<p>My interest is more than curiosity, I’ve been thinking about and working on retroactive funding mechanisms for ~8 years now, and I’m reaching the place where I’m ready to start putting ideas into practice.</p>\n<p>If it’s possible, I’d love to implement these ideas and learn with you!</p>\n<p>The mechanism set itself is more than I can fit here.

How does the voting schedule work in Optimism's Token House governance?,"According to the information provided, the voting schedule for Optimism's Token House governance works as follows:

- It operates on a seasonal schedule, with each season separated by a Reflection Period.

- During each season, voting occurs in three-week voting cycles. 

- Each three-week voting cycle has three one-week stages:

1. Week 1 - Community Feedback Draft: Proposals are posted as drafts on the governance forum for community feedback.

2. Week 2 - Delegate Feedback Review: Token House delegates provide feedback on proposals that meet requirements and received community feedback. Two delegates with >0.5% voting power must explicitly approve a proposal to move to voting.

3. Week 3 - Voting: Approved proposals move to a vote on Snapshot for all delegates and OP token holders who have self-delegated.

- Voting cycles begin on Thursdays at 19:00 GMT (12pm PST) and end on Wednesdays at 19:00 GMT (12pm PST) two weeks later.

- After each season concludes, there is a Reflection Period where the Optimism Foundation proposes changes to the governance process based on feedback. Special Voting Cycles may occur during Reflection Periods to vote on proposed process changes.

So in summary, it follows a recurring 3-week draft/feedback/voting cycle structure within broader seasonal periods, with breaks for reflection and process refinement between seasons.",15.267170667648315,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Updates  and Announcements 📢', 'thread_title': 'Governance Update #2', 'creation_time': '2022-07-21T18:43:50.515000+00:00', 'username': 'ben-chain', 'moderator': True, 'admin': False, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '48.3056.10500'}, page_content='<h2>\n<a name=""voting-underway-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#voting-underway-1""></a><strong>Voting Underway</strong>\n</h2>\n<p>Optimism’s Token House is up and running!

To understand what’s working and what’s not, we’ve been collecting feedback from proposal authors, delegates, and other members of our community. We’ve heard a few common themes:</p>\n<p><strong>There are too many proposals to review.</strong> In our current governance structure, every project proposal is put up for a vote by the entire Token House. The Governance Fund received dozens of proposals in the first two voting cycles alone. Ideally, each proposal gets feedback before voting begins; with so many individual votes, this is hard to make happen.</p>\n<p><strong>There’s no time between voting cycles</strong>. Voting cycles run every two weeks. Cycles begin on Thursday at 7p GMT and end 13 days later on Wednesday at 7p GMT. Our hypothesis was that proposal authors would leave their submissions in “draft” mode until they’d received feedback, then submit to a voting cycle when ready. Instead, we’re learning that authors submit to a voting cycle even if they’re received minimal feedback – there are no guidelines suggesting otherwise! This means many delegates both review and vote within the same two week period and don’t have time to get to the incoming “draft” proposals.</p>\n<p><strong>Some proposals don’t have enough background info.</strong> Delegates aren’t familiar with every project submitting a proposal. While some proposals come from well-known crypto projects, others come from smaller or more specific projects unknown to many delegates. In order to evaluate proposals well, delegates have expressed the need for better context-setting and background info, or more time for research.</p>\n<p><strong>Communication channels are challenging.</strong> Our governance process spans Discord, Discourse, and Snapshot. Community members have expressed confusion or frustration at having to track conversations across multiple platforms <img src=""https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/hot_face.png?v=12"" title="":hot_face:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":hot_face:"" loading=""lazy"" width=""20"" height=""20""></p>\n<p><strong>Some parts of the governance process are underspecified.</strong> v0.1 governance process as defined in the Operating Manual lacks clear instructions on a few situations that have come up in the first two voting cycles: how to re-submit a proposal which previously passed, rules around conflicts of interest, and precise submission deadlines.</p>\n<p><strong>Lack of alignment on Governance Fund scope.</strong> Our <a href=""https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/"">governance documentation</a> says the Governance Fund exists to encourage the “proactive growth of the Optimism ecosystem,” and there is a distinct allocation of OP for public goods funding. Nevertheless, there’s still plenty of room for interpretation of “proactive growth.” Should the GovFund be used to compensate development teams? Can closed-source projects apply for funding? Can some public goods be considered as promoting proactive growth despite the separate bucket? There’s been good discussion on these and similar questions in the Discord.</p>\n<h2>\n<a name=""gov-fund-guidelines-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#gov-fund-guidelines-3""></a>Gov Fund Guidelines</h2>\n<p>As Governance Fund grants are approved are distributed, our community has raised questions about individual projects’ use of the tokens they receive.</p>\n<p>Teams who receive grants from the Governance Fund <strong>must be able to account for all transactions that touch any portion of their grant funds</strong>. And while this may be obvious, we expect no self-dealing. If any expenditure can be construed as self-dealing, we expect the team to be clear about this in advance and include why it’s <em>not</em> self-dealing. Withdrawals of the grant from the Optimism network should also be clearly stated and justified.</p>\n<p>We’re grateful to our community for holding projects accountable to their proposals.

How is Citizenship in the Citizens' House expected to evolve over time?,"Based on the information provided, Citizenship in the Optimism Collective's Citizens' House is expected to evolve over time through an iterative governance process. Here are some key points about how it will likely evolve:

- Initially, participants received temporary badges to vote in the Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) rounds. However, holding these badges does not guarantee future voting rights.

- The criteria and process for selecting Citizens will be determined collaboratively by Optimism's two-house governance system - the Token House and the Citizens' House itself.

- Reputation data from Optimism's AttestationStation contract, which allows recording attestations about individuals, will be used to determine Citizenship eligibility criteria. Things like praise, contributions, alignments with the project's values, etc. could become relevant reputation attributes.

- Governance proposals like ""Improving Governance Accessibility through Praise and Contribution Based Attestations"" and ""REGEN Score - Attestations for the Citizen's House"" have already passed, focusing on gathering relevant reputation data for future Citizenship selection.

- The Citizenship selection criteria is intended to evolve iteratively through governance processes rather than being prescribed upfront. This allows flexibility to adapt the criteria over time based on the Collective's needs.

- Citizens are meant to represent individual human stakeholders - builders, users, community members aligned with Optimism's values and interested in the long-term benefit of the Collective.

So in essence, Citizenship will transition from the initial temporary badges to a more robust, reputation-based model defined through Optimism's novel governance system, allowing it to iteratively evolve the selection criteria over time.",15.743773937225342,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Updates  and Announcements 📢', 'thread_title': ""2nd Citizens' House community call [August 1st @ 9am PT / 12pm ET / 6pm CET]"", 'creation_time': '2023-08-01T12:11:22.996000+00:00', 'username': 'maxsemenchuk', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 1, 'id': '48.6477.28592'}, page_content='<p>I would like to add the topic: “Future Citizenship Selection Criteria” – a brief discussion about what current citizens think about those criteria</p>\n<p>Also more details are in a thread here: <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/future-citizenship-selection-criteria/6558"" class=""inline-onebox"">Future Citizenship Selection Criteria</a></p>'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Citizens  👥', 'thread_title': 'About the Citizens  👥 category', 'creation_time': '2024-02-01T18:04:40.380000+00:00', 'username': 'vonnie610', 'moderator': True, 'admin': True, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '79.7579.33582'}, page_content='<p>This category is for all things relating to Citizens!</p>\n<p><strong>What are Citizens?</strong><br>\nCitizens are members of the Citizens’ House, which comprises one half of the Collective’s governance system.

Citizens are meant to represent individual human stakeholders of the Collective: builders, users, and community members who are aligned with the project’s values and are interested in the long-term benefit of the Collective.\nThis is distinct from the more common pattern of token-voting governance (as used in [Optimism’s Token House](./token-house.md)).  \n<img width=""auto"" alt=""Optimism Identity"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27849965/219097012-a21ebb1f-66dc-47a8-8b3f-6382774ad5d6.png"">  \nIn the initial stage of bootstrapping the Citizens\' House, participants receive temporary badges to vote in Retro Funding rounds.\nIn future stages, the Token House and Citizens’ House together will collaborate on ongoing criteria for participation in the Citizens’ House.\nThis means the criteria for Citizenship will evolve over time.

How is the scope and voting process for Retro Funding determined?,"According to the information provided, the scope and voting process for Retro Funding rounds are determined through an iterative and experimental approach by the Optimism Foundation, with input from the community and governance participants.

For the scope:

- The Foundation decides on the scope and voting mechanics for the first several Retro Funding rounds, with input from the community.
- Over time, the goal is for the Citizens' House (governance participants) to take over defining the scope, with checks and balances from the Token House.
- The scope outlines the type of impact that will be rewarded in a given round, e.g. onchain builders, OP stack contributors, governance improvements, etc.
- Narrowing down the scope (compared to previous broad rounds) is an intentional experiment based on feedback from participants that more focused rounds would improve the evaluation experience.

For the voting process:

- The Foundation is experimenting with different voting designs like metric-based evaluation and impact juries, based on feedback from previous rounds.
- For example, in Retro Funding 4, participants will vote by weighting different impact metrics instead of voting on individual projects directly.
- The goal is to find voting mechanisms that allow participants to more accurately evaluate and reward different types of impact.
- Governance participants provide input into the design of impact metrics and voting algorithms through surveys, workshops and dedicated feedback channels.
- Over time, the Citizens' House is expected to take over ratifying and defining the voting process for future rounds.

So in summary, the scope and voting process are being iteratively designed by the Foundation based on learnings from previous rounds, with increasing input and ratification from governance participants, in line with Optimism's vision of progressive decentralization of the governance process.",29.218312978744507,"[Document(metadata={'header 2': 'A Commitment to Experimentation', 'header 3': 'Experimentation Framework', 'path': 'governance', 'document_name': 'citizens-house.md'}, page_content='Retro Funding has three core components, each with substantial surface area for experimentation.  \n1. **Impact scoping**: what should the Collective fund?\nHow is it defined and decided on?\n1. **Impact scoring:** how does the Citizens’ House evaluate impact?\nWhat units, process, or tools do we use?\n1. **Impact settlement:** how does voting work?  \nFor the first several rounds of Retro Funding, the Optimism Foundation will decide on scope and voting mechanics with input from the community.\nEventually the set of variables around what to fund, how much to fund, and how to vote will be up to the Citizens’ House, with checks and balances from the Token House.  \nOver time, the Collective aims to expand the scope of Retro Funding to support the production of public goods beyond the immediate Optimism ecosystem.\nTo get there, we must refine the tools and processes used for Retro Funding based on regular experimentation.'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'ARCHIVED  & OLD Missions', 'thread_title': '[DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Pocket Network', 'creation_time': '2022-11-09T19:58:10.532000+00:00', 'username': 'marc', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '63.3780.16538'}, page_content='<p>To answer your questions:</p>\n<aside class=""quote no-group"" data-username=""duckie3351"" data-post=""5"" data-topic=""3780"">\n<div class=""title"">\n<div class=""quote-controls""></div>\n<img loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""24"" height=""24"" src=""https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/duckie3351/48/2310_2.png"" class=""avatar""> duckie3351:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was unaware of this and unable to find info online that details it.

This round seeks to expand the reach and impact of the network by rewarding those building across the Superchain who have increased demand for blockspace and driven value to the Collective.</p>\n<h3><a name=""timeline-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#timeline-2""></a>Timeline</h3>\n<p>Please note that all dates are preliminary and might change.

Impact will be rewarded within the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demand generated for Optimism Blockspace</li>\n<li>Interactions from repeat Optimism users</li>\n<li>Interactions from Optimism users with high trust scores</li>\n<li>Interactions of new Optimism users</li>\n<li>Open Source license of contract code</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=""eligibility-criteria-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#eligibility-criteria-4""></a>Eligibility Criteria</h2>\n<p>In Retro Funding 3, the Retro Funding sign up process saw a large influx of spam and low-quality applications. By setting stronger eligibility criteria in Retro Funding 4, the Foundation aims to provide clarity to builders and reduce the amount of human review required for spam and low-quality application. In addition, qualifying criteria reduce the number of applicants who have not generated sufficient impact to receive rewards (such as the below requirement of a minimum number of unique address interactions). The below eligibility criteria aim to strike a balance between broad inclusivity and sufficient requirements to allow for an operationally viable Retro Funding round.</p>\n<p><strong>Builders are eligible who have</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deployed their onchain contracts on one or multiple of the following OP chains: OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal and Metal, and meet the following criteria:\n<ul>\n<li>Onchain contracts have interactions from 420 unique addresses during Jan 1st - May 1st 2024</li>\n<li>Onchain contracts had their first transaction before April 1st 2024</li>\n<li>Onchain contract had more than 10 days of activity during Jan 1st - May 1st 2024</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Verified their onchain contracts in the Retro Funding sign up process</li>\n<li>Made their contract code available in a public Github repo, for which ownership has been verified in the Retro Funding sign up process</li>\n<li>Confirmed that they will comply with Optimism Foundation KYC requirements and are not residing in a sanctioned country</li>\n<li>Submitted a Retro Funding application before June 6th, 2024 and comply with application rules</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=""round-sizing-10m-op-to-reward-onchain-builders-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#round-sizing-10m-op-to-reward-onchain-builders-5""></a>Round Sizing: 10m OP to reward Onchain Builders</h2>\n<p>Retro Funding 4 will allocated 10m OP to reward the impact of Onchain Builders. The OP token allocation for Retro Funding 4 should reflect the impact generated by onchain builders, as well as set a strong incentive for the continuous generation of demand for Optimism blockspace.<br>\nBelow you find some considerations which informed the Foundation’s round sizing decision:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Underallocation to Onchain Builders in Retro Funding 3:</strong> Previously, Retro Funding 3 allocated a total of <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521"">1.5M out of 30M OP</a> to the top 20% of applicants who generated network usage. There has been <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521"">strong feedback from badgeholders and community</a> members that this allocation was too low and should be increased in future rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Growth in developer activity since last round:</strong> The Collective is focused on growing the number of active onchain developers. Developer activity, across the Superchain, <a href=""https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity#op-chains-revenue-generating-deployer-addresses"">has seen a large increase over the past six months</a>. Thus, Retro Funding rewards to these types of contributions should increase to reflect this increase in impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Collective sustainability:</strong> In Retro Funding 3, badgeholders have <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521"">raised concerns around Retro Funding sustainability</a>. Retro Funding currently relies on the Retroactive Public Goods Funding token allocation of 850M OP for rewards. <a href=""https://optimism.mirror.xyz/PLrAQgE1EGRo7GRrFoztplFChnUZda4DFGW3dkQayxY"">In the future</a>, Retro Funding will rely on surplus protocol revenue as the source of rewards. Currently, <a href=""https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity#op-collective-contribution"">Total Collective Contributions</a> (of surplus protocol revenue) fall short of what is needed to sustain Retroactive Public Goods Funding. Additionally, in Retro Funding 3, badgeholders raised points <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521"">around the relationship of rewards to the sequencer revenue</a>, to ensure rewards don’t exceed the sequencer revenue itself. By allocating a significant amount of OP to rewarding onchain builders, the Citizens’ House is incentivizing developer growth and increased network activity.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=""future-round-sizing-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#future-round-sizing-6""></a>Future round sizing</h3>\n<p>The Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 &amp; 5, and will proposes round sizes for Retro Funding 6 &amp; 7, to be ratified by the Citizens’ House. In the future, this process will gradually transition to be more community-led, which may involve the creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons. Round sizing decisions are currently informed by the amount of impact observed within the Collective, considerations for incentivising contributors to take action, and sustainability of Retro Funding rewards. In the future, these decisions should be made based on a framework which takes a number of established measurements and criteria into. We invite Data NERDs to explore measurements and criteria which will inform governance participants to make informed budgeting decisions in the future.</p>\n<h2><a name=""voting-design-7"" class=""anchor"" href=""#voting-design-7""></a>Voting design</h2>\n<p>Retro Funding 4 experiments with <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/upcoming-retro-rounds-and-their-design/7861"">Metrics-based Evaluation</a>, with the hypothesis that by leveraging quantitive metrics, citizens are able to more accurately express their preferences for the types of impact they want to reward, as well as make more accurate judgements of the impact delivered by individual contributors.<br>\nIn stark contrast to other Retro Funding experiments, badgeholders will not vote on individual projects but will rather vote via selecting and weighting a number of metrics which measure different types of impact. You can find out more about prototypes and explorations that informed this design <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimentation-impact-metric-based-voting/7727"">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact metrics</strong><br>\nAll Citizens will be asked to vote in Retro Funding 4 and will be invited to actively shape and input on the design of impact metrics via discussions on the forum as well as a workshop.

Upon sign-up, Warpcast currently charges a $7 fee to rent storage on the network. As a decentralized social network, Farcaster content is not stored on centrally controlled servers, but rather in Hubs, which are a [distributed network of servers](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/hubs). Each unit of storage buys 5000 casts, 2500 reactions and 2500 follows. For those who prefer to register a Farcaster account via contracts directly, this can be done via the [ID Registry Contract](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/contracts). Storage can be rented via the [Storage Registry Contract](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/contracts).

How long do I need to offer support before becoming a `support-NERD`?,"According to the requirements outlined in the documentation, there is a multi-step process to become a `support-NERD`:

1. You must be in the Optimism Discord for at least 2 months and actively offering support by answering questions, tagging support-nerds for questions you can't answer, reporting issues, etc. for at least 2 months.

2. After meeting those initial requirements, you post proof in the #wannabe-NERD channel. If approved, you are given the `nerd-in-training` role.

3. You must then continue offering support as a `nerd-in-training` for an additional 2 months. 

4. After that 2 month `nerd-in-training` period, if your support has been of high quality, an existing NERD will nominate you to become a full `support-NERD`.

5. The nomination is voted on by current support-NERDs, and you need a majority (50%) vote to be ratified as a new `support-NERD`.

So in total, the minimum time requirement is around 5 months - 2 months offering initial support, followed by 2 more months as a `nerd-in-training`, before being able to be nominated and voted in as a full `support-NERD`.",13.613635063171387,"[Document(metadata={'path': 'contribute/contribution-path', 'document_name': 'NERD-req.md'}, page_content='---\ntitle: Support NERD Requirements\nlang: en-US\n---  \n::: tip\n💡 So you want to be an optimistic NERD ‘ey?

How should badgeholders measure the Council’s impact?,"Based on the information provided, there are a few suggestions on how badgeholders could measure the impact of the Council:

1. Use quantitative metrics where possible
For contributions like on-chain contracts, open source libraries etc. where rich data is available, quantitative metrics like number of users, transactions, code usage etc. can be leveraged to evaluate impact. However, it is noted that not all contributions lend themselves well to quantitative measurement.

2. Incorporate qualitative assessment 
For contributions like events, education initiatives, off-chain tooling etc. where standardized quantitative data may be lacking, there is a need to incorporate qualitative human assessment and judgement into the impact evaluation process. The idea is that for contributions targeting human experience, human experience should be the measuring stick.

3. Develop clear definitions and frameworks
There seems to be a need for clearer definitions of what constitutes ""impact"" in different contexts, as well as frameworks to guide badgeholders in evaluating impact consistently. Facilitated discussions could help surface different perspectives on this.

4. Improve tooling and processes
Optimizing the voting experience for badgeholders, such as through better tooling that allows easy comparison of contributions, is recommended to improve the impact assessment process.

5. Increase transparency
Greater transparency into the rationale for funding certain initiatives over others, and the resulting impact of those choices, could help badgeholders evaluate the Council's performance.

In essence, a balanced mixed-methods approach leveraging both quantitative and qualitative techniques, guided by clear frameworks, and enabled by good tooling and transparency seems to be the recommended path forward for badgeholders to comprehensively measure the Council's impact.",15.77024793624878,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Retro  Funding 🔴', 'thread_title': 'RetroPGF 3: Round Design', 'creation_time': '2023-09-12T15:06:08.813000+00:00', 'username': 'CryptoReuMD', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '46.6802.29402'}, page_content='<aside class=""quote no-group"" data-username=""system"" data-post=""1"" data-topic=""6802"">\n<div class=""title"">\n<div class=""quote-controls""></div>\n<img loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""24"" height=""24"" src=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png"" class=""avatar""> system:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>How can the Collective gather more high quality data for the evaluation of impact &amp; profit?</strong></em><br>\nRound 2 suffered from low-quality data, consisting of qualitative descriptions from projects on their impact &amp; profit.

A strong, data-driven approach to determining which categories of contributions should be retro funded is a key part of transitioning the responsibility of setting round scope to the Citizens’ House. Understanding the impact of excluding any contributions is an important part of this analysis.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Facilitated Discussions:</strong> I strongly believe there was a <strong>big missed opportunity for more structured and inclusive discussions on what is defined as impact within the Optimism Collective</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There will be several opportunities for this coming up!

How were the badgeholders for RetroPGF Round 2 selected?,"According to the information provided, the badgeholders for RetroPGF Round 2 were selected across four different criteria:

1. 14 badgeholders were selected based on their participation as badgeholders in Round 1 of RetroPGF.

2. 21 badgeholders were selected by the Optimism Foundation.

3. 10 badgeholders were elected by Optimism's Token House through a Snapshot vote. 

4. 29 badgeholders were nominated by the badgeholders from the three categories above.

""The Law of Chains is fundamentally social in nature, intended to guide Optimism Governance and participants in the Optimism Collective. It is not a legal contract, and provides no legally enforceable warranties, representations, indemnities, rights, or obligations.""

The Law of Chains serves as a set of guiding principles and rules for participants in the Optimism ecosystem, but it does not establish any legally enforceable rights or obligations. It is meant to be enforced through the Optimism Governance processes and protocol upgrades, not through legal means.

The disclaimer explicitly states that if legally enforceable guarantees are needed from specific parties, then a separate legal contract would be required. The Law of Chains by itself does not create any contractual relationships or legal bindings between participants.

In essence, the Law of Chains represents a social commitment and set of guidelines that ecosystem participants voluntarily subscribe to, rather than a legally binding agreement. Its enforcement relies on the Optimism Governance mechanisms outlined in the document.",11.500917911529541,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'General  Discussions ✨ ', 'thread_title': '[FINAL] Law of Chains v0.1', 'creation_time': '2023-11-01T15:34:16.875000+00:00', 'username': 'ben-chain', 'moderator': True, 'admin': False, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '1.6514.30849'}, page_content='<p>We recognize the technical nature of the current Law of Chains.

It is not a legal contract, and provides no legally enforceable warranties, representations, indemnities, rights, or obligations.  Participants commit to the Law of Chains independently.  No party acquires the ability to bind the other by virtue of their shared commitment to these guidelines.  \n:::  \nThe Law of Chains is intended to provide guidance to ecosystem participants.  It does not establish any legally enforceable rights or obligations.  Its contents do not have the effect of law and are not meant to legally bind the public or any person in any way.  \nFor example, the Law of Chains presents a concept of “Participant Protections.”  This framing is intended to reflect elevated importance; a matter of principle. But Participant Protections are not, and do not create, legal rights, or corresponding legal obligations. They are not absolutely guaranteed to any ecosystem participant.  \nIf Participant Protections are violated, one may appeal to Optimism Governance.  This is like saying: “one may appeal to the democratic process.”  Optimism Governance is not a legal entity or a singular adjudicative body.  It is a collection of many unaffiliated, independent, and uncoordinated individual voters.  Its outcomes cannot be guaranteed.  \nRelatedly, participants that subscribe to the Law of Chains do so independently, and they conduct themselves independently under it, bearing their own risks and rewards. No party acquires the ability to contractually bind the other by virtue of their shared commitment to these guidelines. The Law of Chains does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship among anyone.  \nThe Law of Chains is a set of guidelines.  It is not a contract.  If you need legally enforceable guarantees from specific people or entities, you need some kind of specific contract with them. This document, standing alone, is not that.

We think it might be worthwhile to distinguish two other groups that have a tremendous impact on the network and its’ dynamics - Superchain Builders and the OP Token Holders.</p>\n<p>Both groups have an existential interest in the Superchain future and might have interests/pain points that are not necessarily in line with the groups already mentioned. Not taking their perspective into account, and especially merging them all within one broad ‘Users’ group might result with misunderstandings. One such misunderstanding would be in the case of a conflict between asset holders and smart contract deployers.</p>\n<p>As stated in §7.a: <code>In the event there is a conflict between different Participant Protections, User Protections will supersede all other Participant Protections.</code><br>\nUsers are defined us <code>Any party that holds assets or transacts on an OP Chain or deploys a smart contract to an OP Chain is acting in their capacity as a User.</code></p>\n<p>So in a conflict between asset holders and smart contract deployers, who has the priority?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It might be useful to elaborate a bit on what “The Platform” is. Since the Law of Chains defines how we collectively manage the “Platform” it is crucial that everyone has a shared understanding, at least on a higher level, of what The Platform is.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An important distinction to be made is between what constitutes the common infrastructure managed and governed by the collective and what are the parameters that each Superchain member-chain governs independently on its own.</p>\n<p>If this has not yet been decided and is deliberately not specified in the Law of Chains, it would be worth stating this directly and mentioning the process that will lead to its clarification.</p>\n<ol start=""3"">\n<li>In §6, we read: <code>Survival: The Platform must be able to evolve in response to threats that pose a real, existential risk to the Platform as whole.</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We’re curious to know how is the Platform going to address this issue?</p>\n<p>In our opinion addressing this would require allocating some form resources since in order to evolve, the Platform needs a team or even multiple teams working on it and The Collective needs to be able to define the direction in which it wants the Platform to evolve (i.e. define the development road-map and ensure its execution).</p>\n<p>The other requirements mentioned in the ‘Platform as Commons’ section, sustainability and security, are already being addressed by the OP chains sharing the revenue, and by the Security Council. However, we don’t really understand how survival is going to be addressed in the future.</p>\n<ol start=""4"">\n<li>\n<p>In the current context of the Law of Chains, we are not sure about the exact meaning of Governance minimisation. While we agree with the overall approach of turning rules enforced only on the social layer into code-enforced mechanisms, we also think that it needs to be further specified.<br>\nWhat governance mechanisms, structures or processes do we envision in the future and how do we see the role of each of the governance participants within those are just some of the questions that immediately come to mind.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is also the question of how is the Law of Chains going to be maintained in the future?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is stated that <code>the Law of Chains will require adaptation to changing circumstances as the Collective defines itself, evolves, and grows iteratively over time</code>, but there is no mention of a process for these iterations to take place.</p>\n<p>The first version of Law of Chains has been drafted by the Foundation and will be ratified by the Collective, but how is it going to be worked it in the future? If we want the Optimism ecosystem to be sufficiently decentralised, then we shouldn’t just be voting on the changes but rather we should collectively be discussing the required adaptations. How will we ensure that all relevant stakeholders will participate and have a say in the discussion?</p>\n<ol start=""6"">\n<li>Lastly, the Law of Chains provides a structure for the rules of participation in the Superchain, but it does not currently define any process or rules regarding how will we onboard/offboard participants to the Superchain.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Right now this seems to be handled by the Foundation, as we saw with <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/welcoming-base-to-optimism-governance/6689"">the Base announcement</a>, but what would that process look like in the future? In the “Future Of Optimism Governance” blog post, it is mentioned that <code>This meta-governance power marks the end of the Foundation’s stewardship of the evolution of Collective governance and entrusts the governance community with continued experimentation towards a healthy end-state for Optimism.</code></p>\n<p>It is our understanding that the Foundation’s role as a steward of The Collective will come to an end at some point in the future. When that happens, who will be responsible for onboarding and offboarding participants to the Superchain?</p>\n<p>In our opinion The Law of Chains is a good step towards a better future of decentralized management of Superchain, but now it needs a lot of discussion about its clarification. We are definitely willing to take part in those discussions and to help brainstorm ideas around it.</p>\n<p>If anybody wants to discuss the Law of Chains or any other issues regarding Optimism Governance, we would like to invite you to our Optimism Office Hours taking place every Tuesday, 3pm UTC at <a href=""https://meet.google.com/pem-jzrh-gkq"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">https://meet.google.com/pem-jzrh-gkq</a>.</p>')]"

What actions can lead to losing my NERD status?,"According to the Optimism documentation, there are a few actions that can lead to losing your NERD (Optimism community support) status:

1. If you scam a user or send spam in any channel, you will lose your NERD role and be banned for life from ever becoming a NERD again, as well as banned from the Discord.

2. Being rude to users will get you kicked from the NERDs role and temporarily banned from the Discord for 3 days. 

3. Giving false or fake information to users can lead to losing your NERD rights and getting banned or temporarily banned depending on how severe the misinformation was.

4. NERDs are sometimes told sensitive information before it is public. If you leak any private information given to NERDs, you will lose the NERD role and be barred from ever becoming a NERD again.

So in summary, scamming, spamming, being rude, providing misinformation, or leaking private NERD information can all result in losing your privileged NERD status within the Optimism community.

What actions can lead to losing your Ambassador status?,"According to the Optimism documentation, there are a few key actions that can lead to losing your Ambassador status:

1. Scamming your follower base - This includes things like pump and dump schemes, whether related to Optimism or not. Ambassadors are not allowed to take advantage of their followers.

2. Impersonating a creator or team member - Pretending to be someone else, such as stealing their profile photo, is grounds for removal.

3. Leaking sensitive information - Ambassadors may occasionally get access to private information before it's public. Leaking this private information will result in losing Ambassador status.

4. Doxing or other serious violations - Publishing identifying information about another community member without permission, or committing other serious violations, can lead to being removed as an Ambassador.

What are Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) rounds?,"Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) rounds are a series of experiments by the Optimism Collective to allocate funds to projects and individuals that have provided positive impact and public goods to the Optimism ecosystem.

The key points about RetroPGF rounds are:

1. They are retroactive, meaning they reward work that has already been completed, rather than funding future work upfront.

2. The goal is to realize the principle of ""impact = profit"" - rewarding those who have created positive impact for the Optimism Collective with proportional profits/rewards.

3. In each round, the Optimism Citizens' House allocates a portion of funds (e.g. surplus protocol revenue or token allocations) to projects they assess as having provided valuable impact.

4. The scope of what ""impact"" is rewarded is defined for each round. For example, in RetroPGF Round 3, the scope was contributions supporting the development and adoption of Optimism across 4 categories: OP Stack, Governance, Developer Ecosystem, and End User Experience.

5. Projects apply by self-reporting their contributions, impact metrics, and any profits/funding they have already received. The Citizens' House then evaluates and votes on which projects to fund based on their impact vs. existing profits.

6. It is an experimental mechanism to sustainably fund and incentivize public goods creation for the Optimism ecosystem in a decentralized manner aligned with Optimism's vision.

So in essence, RetroPGF rounds allow the Optimism community to retroactively allocate rewards to projects providing positive impact, filling the gap between their impact and existing profits.",15.924386262893677,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Retro  Funding 🔴', 'thread_title': 'RetroPGF 3: Round Design', 'creation_time': '2023-12-13T07:01:39.520000+00:00', 'username': 'Vincent_APACDAO', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 1, 'id': '46.6802.31692'}, page_content='<p>Hi, would be great if the Optimism community can have more details about the RetroPGF 3; Round Design covering the matters below.</p>\n<p>(1)  The concept of public goods funding its significance to the Optimism ecosystem.</p>\n<p>(2)  The learning objectives for RetroPGF 3 particularly the specific aims to be achieved through this round and how it builds on the lessons learned from the previous rounds.</p>\n<p>(3) The specific metrics or benchmarks to measure the success of the improvements such as what are the measurement metrics “better data quality” whether in terms of data accuracy or completeness etc.</p>\n<p>(4) Some hypothetical scenarios or case studies to illustrate how badgeholders can use Lists effectively to help them visualize the practical application of this new tool.</p>\n<p>(5) The steps to actively participate and contribute to the ongoing development of the system whether it’s signing up, providing feedback, or participating in the RetroPGF initiative.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to some information on the above.</p>\n<p>Cheers.</p>'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Feedback  💬', 'thread_title': 'RetroPGF Round 3 Feedback Thread', 'creation_time': '2023-12-02T09:23:35.894000+00:00', 'username': 'stalim17', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 1, 'id': '82.6177.31418'}, page_content='<p>Retroactive Public Goods Funding is the engine that drives the growth of the Optimism ecosystem.</p>\n<p>RetroPGF aims to effectively allocate capital to the builders whose efforts have provided public good to the Collective.</p>\n<p>Our Optimism translators voluntarily translated the official articles and official help docs(on CrowdIn) of the Optimism Foundation into each country’s native language.

This principle serves as a North Star, motivating the creation of a more productive and sustainable economy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact</strong> signifies the value a contributor has created for the Optimism Collective.</li>\n<li><strong>Profit</strong> signifies the value a contributor has extracted from the Optimism Collective.</li>\n<li><strong>The gap</strong> signifies the difference between a contributor’s impact and profit.<br>\n(e.g. impact - profit = the gap)</li>\n<li>RetroPGF fills the gap between a contributors impact and profit, resulting in a state of <strong>impact = profit.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=""defining-impact-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#defining-impact-2""></a>Defining <strong>Impact</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Retroactive</em> means that there should be no forward looking assumptions. Only past impact is considered.<br>\nImpact measurement should not include any considerations for the future contributions of a project or individual (e.g. how much impact will they have in the future? How important are the rewards to enable their future work?). Future contributions can and should be rewarded in future RetroPGF rounds.</li>\n<li><em>Impact</em> measures the outcomes that were created for the Collective.<br>\nImpact does not consider the inputs that went into a particular contribution (e.g. how many people have worked on a contribution or how many hours were spent).</li>\n<li>Each round has a scope which outlines the public goods and impact that are rewarded. In RetroPGF 3, the scope is to reward contribution that have supported the development and adoption of Optimism. There are four impact categories defining this further:\n<ol>\n<li><strong>OP Stack</strong>: Work that enhanced the efficiency, security, resilience, and awareness of the OP Stack.</li>\n<li><strong>Collective Governance</strong>: Work that provided impact to governance participants of the Optimism Collective, or helped bring new governance participants into the Collective.</li>\n<li><strong>Developer Ecosystem</strong>: Work that provided impact to application developers in the Optimism Collective, or helped bring new developers into the Collective.</li>\n<li><strong>End User Experience &amp; Adoption</strong>: Work that provided impact to end users in the Optimism Collective, or helped bring new end users into the Collective.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=""defining-profit-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#defining-profit-3""></a>Defining <strong>Profit</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Profit</strong> signifies the value a contributor has extracted from the Optimism Collective. This refers to the Collective as a whole, as well as individual members of the Collective.<br>\n”Profit” is not defined in the classical sense of “money earned after paying costs”, but defined as the total value a contributor has extracted from the Optimism Collective.</p>\n<p>Value extraction may come in different forms. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Collective paying for a contributor’s service or product\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Foundation payment of an annual fee in USD to different service providers, such as block explorers</li>\n<li>E.g.

There are suggestions to have a public registry of cases handled by the Council to increase transparency, as well as having ""supportNERDs"" who can monitor the Council's work and provide accountability through mid and end-of-season reports.

2. Improving the intake process to detect and address potential violations earlier, before they escalate into severe public incidents. The idea is to open up reporting forms so the Council can address smaller breaches of trust or conflicting patterns proactively, rather than only getting involved for severe violations that merit temporary bans.

3. Considering the use of third-party mediation providers to handle the more time-intensive alternative dispute resolution steps, so the Council's availability is not compromised by a few complex cases.

4. Continuously improving and evolving the Code of Conduct practices over time, as it is still a relatively new experiment that has room for enhancements each season based on learnings.

In summary, the key concerns seem to revolve around increasing transparency, being more proactive in addressing issues before escalation, efficient resource allocation, and an iterative approach to improving enforcement mechanisms over time.",13.273006200790405,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Accountability  🗂️', 'thread_title': 'Rules of Engagement 2.0', 'creation_time': '2023-03-24T17:40:22.086000+00:00', 'username': 'system', 'moderator': True, 'admin': True, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '62.5728.24504'}, page_content='<p>Please carefully read and understand the following Rules of Engagement for the Optimism Collective.

Conflict is something that evolves over time, and <strong>“A Stitch in time saves nine”</strong>. The tearing of the social fabric does not happen only in huge rips, it can also start with small breaches of trust. I think being able to see these issues with time helps prevent uncontrolled situations and allows the council to do better in their intention of dealing with cases.

What are some concerns related to the cost of on-chain voting?,"Based on the documents provided, there are a few key concerns raised regarding the cost of on-chain voting for the Optimism governance:

1. Inclusivity and accessibility concerns:
Some participants argue that requiring on-chain voting with associated gas costs could exclude participants from less wealthy countries or those with smaller OP token holdings from being able to vote freely. Paying even a small amount like $1.30 per vote may be prohibitive for some. This goes against the goal of having an inclusive governance process.

2. Unnecessary costs for signaling votes:
There is a view that for governance votes that are simply signaling intent and do not trigger any on-chain actions, requiring on-chain voting unnecessarily burns money that could be avoided by using off-chain tools like Snapshot for those types of votes.

3. Cost not a major barrier:
Others argue that the projected $0.14 cost per vote on Optimism is very low compared to Layer 1, and that if Optimism's costs are so high that voting is prohibitive, it indicates the protocol is successful in attracting traffic which necessitates secure on-chain voting. There are also potential solutions proposed like free voting interfaces or paying users to vote.

In summary, while some see the voting costs as manageable, others raise valid concerns about maintaining an inclusive governance process accessible to a wide range of participants regardless of location or token holdings. Finding the right balance is key.",14.328755855560303,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Governance  Design 📐', 'thread_title': 'It Is Time For On-Chain OP Voting', 'creation_time': '2022-12-06T21:11:09.036000+00:00', 'username': 'rshuel', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '84.3956.17421'}, page_content='<p>Hi everyone,</p>\n<p>Ross here from a16z. This is a needed post from GFX Labs and Millie detailing realistic considerations for a transition to on-chain voting. We are supportive of a transition away from off-chain voting for a number of reasons. On-chain voting typically results in increased transparency, efficiency, and decentralization. Here are a few additional considerations after observing a number of other protocols implement on-chain/off-chain voting schemas:</p>\n<p><strong>Off-chain + on-chain voting convolutes the governance process</strong>. A number of other protocols have governance schemas that require multiple rounds of off-chain voting before progressing to on-chain voting. This has two effects, which should be balanced against one another:</p>\n<p>(1) Efficiency is decreased due to repeated voting rounds prior to any action, which is desirable in some cases e.g. modifying core code. This is undesirable for more routine operations.</p>\n<p>(2) The true level of proposal support is obfuscated by off-chain voting, sometimes resulting in unexpected outcomes on-chain. Because a significant percentage of voting power belongs to entities that cannot participate in Snapshot voting due to technical constraints, there is often a disparity between Snapshot polling results and actual on-chain votes.</p>\n<p><strong>There are many possible avenues to further reduce the cost of voting on-chain</strong>. As a starting point, GFX Labs’ estimated cost of $0.14/vote at 30 Gwei is significantly lower than L1 voting. The coming implementation of EIP-4844 will further reduce this cost by <a href=""https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1495538286332624898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1495538286332624898%7Ctwgr%5Ebd01b7697c9a8259a8b3893ac4498421e40337ab%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eip4844.com%2F"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">up to two orders of magnitude</a>. As we’ve previously discussed in other threads, there are <a href=""https://a16zcrypto.com/paying-people-to-participate-in-governance/"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">a variety of economic incentive designs</a> to completely alleviate the cost of voting and actually pay ecosystem participants to vote and/or delegate. Additionally, as MakerDAO has demonstrated, the rise of a professional delegate class can also negate the cost of voting for the subset of participants most impacted by voting costs. With all of these factors in mind, we do not think the cost of voting on L2 should materially influence any decisions made regarding on-chain voting mechanics.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, we think it’s important to take a deliberate, thoughtful approach to governance design</strong>. Because governance systems tend to ossify over time, it is far easier to “get it right” upfront rather than rapidly implementing an on-chain voting design and then subsequently seeking to overhaul that governance design later on. Optimism is also in an advantageous position to learn from and build upon the governance designs of numerous other protocols that have already explored various on-chain voting mechanics.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to everyone’s thoughts and contributions as Optimism moves toward on-chain voting!</p>'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Governance  Design 📐', 'thread_title': 'It Is Time For On-Chain OP Voting', 'creation_time': '2023-05-10T08:20:07.348000+00:00', 'username': 'lefterisjp', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '84.3956.25859'}, page_content='<p>I am sorry but I think you have not read my post.

The Collective and OP token started 200 days ago, and since then, the community and protocol have made significant progress toward its goal of supporting public goods, and the Optimism Labs team has continued to be on the bleeding edge of L2 development.</p>\n<p>Over the last five months, OP holders have utilized Snapshot to conduct voting for its grant program. We thank Snapshot for offering a free service that thousands have utilized that is a building block in DeFi governance; however, as a project matures, the governance processes must mature with it. GFX Labs believes it is time for Optimism to transition its governance system to on-chain voting. While the appeal of utilizing Snapshot is for many that it is a free service, OP tokens are not burdened with the same costs as L1 protocols. Additionally, by migrating away from Snapshot, the governance process will become widely accessible and thus easier for many OP holders to participate.</p>\n<p>On-chain voting is the expectation of every quality, decentralized project with a governance token for a good reason. It requires the protocol to make the management of the protocol and its contracts objective. Voting on-chain is transparent and permanent. With on-chain governance, token holders will also manage the treasury and functionality of the protocol directly. In short, it is the gold standard for decentralized governance.</p>\n<p>However, we think a good first step would be to swap out Snapshot for on-chain governance polling, and once a couple of months have passed, then proceed with further steps of decentralization away from team control. For example, after on-chain polling, the foundation could transfer the OP token treasury from their multi-signature contract to the OP token holder’s treasury, and eventually, as core protocol development progresses, the DAO could and should manage the ownership of those contracts as well. Overall, the idea is to continue the process of progressive decentralization. Gradual decentralization on a stated timeline would represent a major improvement to today – where votes have to be <em>hand adjusted</em> by humans in order to avoid disenfranchising thousands of OP addresses that have delegated their votes to a variety of persons.</p>\n<p>The OP token is a standard governance token, so it will be compatible with most popular governance systems. Alternatively, the community could tailor-make its own system. Since these requirements are consistent with most token governance systems, it would be best to adopt an existing, popular, and time-tested solution like Compound’s Governor Bravo, which is also utilized by Uniswap and many other protocols.</p>\n<p>Governor Bravo is a relatively simple governance system. The participants need to choose the proposal threshold, the number of votes an address must have to make a proposal, and the quorum threshold, which is the number of votes a proposal must have to succeed. There are three time parameters to choose from: the review period, voting period, and timelock period (unimportant for deciding off-chain events but very important for on-chain activity).</p>\n<p>The Collective could institute a similar quorum threshold and timing to the existing system. The only major change with this system is that each proposal must have a proposer with the necessary votes. As it stands, the foundation manages the process of posting proposals to Snapshot once two delegates with sufficient voting power have given their approval. In an on-chain system, these delegates must send the proposal themselves. We don’t see this as a material modification and think it has substantially more upside than downside <em>because it requires delegates to have the conviction to sponsor a grant application formally</em>. This exposes delegates to reputational risk if they put forward low-quality proposals.</p>\n<p>While there might be a concern of on-chain voting costs, we’d like to propose a few solutions to OP token holders’ concerns. First, to put things into perspective, voting on mainnet costs about $3.60 at a gas price of 30 Gwei; on Optimism, we project voting to cost approximately 14¢. If 14¢ is too expensive, Optimism could set up a free voting interface for voting via signature similar to Snapshot, but where all votes are broadcast on-chain like <a href=""http://comp.vote/"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">comp.vote</a> &amp; <a href=""http://uni.vote/"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">uni.vote</a>. Ultimately, there will always be a cost to on-chain governance, but OP token holders should remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Perhaps even more importantly, if Optimism’s costs are so high that it is prohibitive to vote, then Optimism is a stunning success for attracting traffic and requires secure, reliable voting more than ever.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we are aware of millions of OP votes and thousands of delegations that are regularly unable to participate in the protocol governance due to the Collective’s reliance on Snapshot. While this hasn’t significantly impacted the historical management of the protocol, it could become a fundamental issue as OP token holders assume more responsibilities in the protocol. While the stakes aren’t critical at this moment, we think it’s best to close the chapter of utilizing Snapshot and move to an on-chain governance system while stakes are still low.</p>\n<p>GFX Labs will do its best to answer any questions over the next week. If the general reception is warm, we’ll submit a formal proposal to move off Snapshot and onto on-chain governance the following week.</p>')]"
What are some examples of projects that can be nominated for the Tooling & Utilities category?,"Based on the information provided, here are some examples of projects that could be nominated for the Tooling & Utilities category in the Optimism Governance's RetroPGF2 funding round:

- Wallets and clients that help users interact with applications built on Optimism, like the Candide wallet proposal mentioned.

- Developer tools and libraries that assist builders in creating applications on Optimism's mainnet or building on top of the OP Stack.

- Infrastructure initiatives related to node operation, analytics services, etc. An example given is the Raptor proposal for node infrastructure.

- Data management tools like analytics dashboards, block explorers specifically focused on Optimism.

- DApps and user interfaces considered as ""tooling"" that help users interact with Optimism, but don't fall into DeFi or NFT categories. The Boardroom proposal is cited as an example.

- Off-chain or cross-chain communication services like oracles, bridges, and liquidity networks that connect Optimism to other chains. The Connext proposal for a bridge is mentioned as an example.

The key criteria is that the nominated project should support development, usage and growth of the Optimism ecosystem and OP Stack in some way, even if it is not exclusively built for Optimism. Projects that provide educational impact about Optimism or are important dependencies of the OP Stack could also potentially qualify.",14.376200914382935,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Retro  Funding 🔴', 'thread_title': 'Tooling & Utilities nominations for RPGF2', 'creation_time': '2023-01-17T20:45:20.106000+00:00', 'username': 'system', 'moderator': True, 'admin': True, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '46.4639.19118'}, page_content='<h1>\n<a name=""tooling-utilities-nominations-for-retropgf2-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#tooling-utilities-nominations-for-retropgf2-1""></a>Tooling &amp; Utilities nominations for RetroPGF2</h1>\n<p>This is the thread to nominate projects for the <strong>Tooling and Utilities</strong> category of <a href=""https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/retropgf-2/#"">RetroPGF round 2</a>.

What are some of the key features and improvements that have been added to Agora based on user feedback?,"Based on the information provided, some of the key features and improvements that have been added or proposed for Agora based on user feedback include:

1. Liquid delegation features:
- Partial delegation - allowing users to delegate only a portion of their tokens instead of all tokens.
- Re-delegation - allowing delegates to sub-delegate votes to other delegates.
- Time-bound delegation - ability to set an expiration date on delegations.
- Token holder override (co-delegation) - allowing token holders to temporarily use their voting power without un-delegating from their delegate.

2. Improved discoverability and filtering for delegates:
- Users have provided feedback that it is difficult to discover new or smaller delegates on Agora, as the default sorting shows mainly large, established delegates.
- Suggestions include adding filters to view delegates by age, only show smaller delegates below a voting power threshold, or have a ""recommended"" section curated by citizens.

3. Governance activity feed and transparency improvements:
- Providing a detailed feed of delegation changes, voting activity, and other governance events.
- Making this governance data available via APIs or public data sources for analysis by the community.
- Open sourcing the Agora codebase for transparency.

4. KPI tracking and measurement:
- Research and implement ways to publicly track and measure key governance metrics and KPIs related to Agora usage and delegation.

The key goals seem to be reducing friction in delegation, improving transparency around governance activities, and ensuring the system remains decentralized by elevating the visibility of newer and smaller delegates.",14.988239765167236,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Accountability  🗂️', 'thread_title': 'Karma - Grantee accountability+feedback thread', 'creation_time': '2023-02-28T19:26:38.903000+00:00', 'username': 'FractalVisions', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 3, 'id': '62.3960.23072'}, page_content='<p>Hey, I really like the platform here and I wanted to give you some feedback on what I thought was really critical for agora and see if you could help with the discovery for delegates as well on your platform because I noticed that it also has a similar issue…</p>\n<aside class=""quote quote-modified"" data-post=""4"" data-topic=""5358"">\n  <div class=""title"">\n    <div class=""quote-controls""></div>\n    <img loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""24"" height=""24"" src=""https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/fractalvisions/48/6661_2.png"" class=""avatar"">\n    <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/agora-vote-optimism-io-feedback-thread/5358/4"">Agora Updates &amp; Feedback thread</a> <a class=""badge-category__wrapper "" href=""/c/governance/41""><span data-category-id=""41"" data-drop-close=""true"" class=""badge-category "" title=""Information on voting cycles, rules &amp; processes, delegation, and the grants program""><span class=""badge-category__name"">🏛 Token House Governance</span></span></a>\n  </div>\n  <blockquote>\n    Discoverability is lacking heavily. \nPartial search <img width=""20"" height=""20"" src=""https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/mag.png?v=12"" title=""mag"" alt=""mag"" class=""emoji""> results in blank page error. \nCausing confusion &amp; requiring the user to type the domain url into the browser to refresh the page. \nThe way that the Agora platform is setup has only been favorable for those who have the most OP delegated to their account. \nIs Agora biased towards the top Delegates because that is how they received approval for their grant ??? \n[image] \nAs you can see here it is impossible to search <img width=""20"" height=""20"" src=""https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/mag.png?v=12"" title=""mag"" alt=""mag"" class=""emoji""> for anyone other t…\n  </blockquote>\n</aside>\n'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'ARCHIVED  & OLD Missions', 'thread_title': '[REVIEW] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Agora', 'creation_time': '2022-10-27T18:59:35.055000+00:00', 'username': 'fig', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '63.3752.15729'}, page_content='<p>In the past, we have been hesitant to support Governance tooling to add unnecessary clutter.</p>\n<p>Agora seems to add new, innovative functionality to increase the voter / delegate UX.</p>\n<p>In particular, we are impressed by the ability for liquid delegation - adjusting more parameters to empower token holders; sub-delegation, vote limitations, and expiration dates, to name a few.</p>\n<p>Reducing friction in the delegation process will lead to greater rates of Governance participation.</p>'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Delegates  🏛', 'thread_title': 'Request for Information - Recent Upgrades to Governor Contract', 'creation_time': '2024-01-25T20:29:20.125000+00:00', 'username': 'brichis', 'moderator': True, 'admin': False, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 3, 'id': '41.7535.33218'}, page_content='<p>As the Lead of the Anticapture Commission, I wish to start by stating that this message aims solely to gather information and enhance transparency.</p>\n<p>In our inaugural Office Hours, several Anticapture Commission members expressed concerns regarding the recent upgrades to the Optimism Governor contract. While we acknowledge and appreciate Agora’s significant contributions to the governance infrastructure of the Optimism Collective, this message is intended to facilitate open dialogue about our concerns, specifically focusing on areas where communication could be improved. Key concerns include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The upgrade has resulted in functional issues on various analytics websites, excluding Agora. Currently, Agora is the sole platform displaying accurate voting power data. Other platforms like Tally, Dune dashboards (including the official Optimism Foundation dashboard), Boardroom, Curia, Opdelegate, and Rotki have some features broken.</li>\n<li>The requirement of signing twice for voting, was unexpected for the community members.</li>\n<li>While discussions are ongoing about getting data through an API run by Agora, in the spirit of decentralization (Intent <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#1</span>), this data should be easily accessible from neutral on-chain sources.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As engaged community members, we request more involvement in decision-making processes, particularly those involving significant upgrades that impact multiple stakeholders within the Collective.

I understand some of my ideas are more related to metagovernance than for agora itself, but some points are still relevant imo (such as the delegate discovereability):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The creation process for the Delegate Commitment page was enjoyable. I like how much easier it is to modify than the legacy version, and how it keeps track of voter stats.</li>\n<li>Voting itself was also fairly painless, the interface is pretty, and I enjoy how easy it is to read the justifications on the page.</li>\n<li>Finally, <strong>one big concern</strong> for me is the Delegates page. Currently, the only two filters are sorting by number of votes delegated and number of delegations (both giving similar results).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of this last point, discoverability of new Delegates has now gone significantly down. Most of the visible votes are delegates which have been here from Season 0, with the most ‘recent’ delegates being from a month after that.</p>\n<p>Of course, all of these people are incredible and have earned their top spots, but I worry that with the current system we will be encouraging new people entering the collective to delegate to the top ~20 delegates, snowballing their voting power. This could mean not only a significantly higher burden on those individual delegates, but a more difficult fight for new Delegates to acquire visibility and power. I’d love to discuss with others what ways we could avoid this centralisation, while also leading users to candidates to trustworthy and high-quality Delegates.</p>\n<p>Some random ideas that come to mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow delegates with more than x% supply to hide their delegation from results. This action could be rewarded in someway to encourage it on active delegates, or could be automatically enforced after a threshold is reached.</li>\n<li>Introduce the option to filter by delegate age (only allow delegates that have voted for either more or less than x months)</li>\n<li>Maybe allow citizen badgeholders to select ‘recommended delegates’ that currently have low delegation, but might be worth highlighting. This is my favourite idea, as it gives a further tie to the bicameral system, makes the selections flexible, and allows some critical curation.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>TL;DR - I would suggest adding some other delegate filters so it’s not only sorting by what is essentially two ways of showing the top delegates.

[research &amp; investigation process outlined below]</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Detailed roadmap &amp; specs:</em></p>\n<p>Workstream 1: Liquid delegation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Partial delegation – where instead of delegating all your tokens, you can choose how much to delegate, and how many people to delegate to. (currently researching the best implementation here)</li>\n<li>Re-delegation: allows your delegate to delegate to another person, up to x times. (this will enable delegates to step down, or others to step up)</li>\n<li>Time-bound assignment: empower a voter for limited duration, votes are automatically revoked at the end of the period.</li>\n<li>Tokenholder override (co-delegation): allows token holder to temporarily use the votes without un-delegating (enable token holder to step in on issues they really care about without undelegating, thereby reducing the risk of delegation)</li>\n<li>Learning touch points: Provide update on feedback from delegate/users research of most desired features and their use cases</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Workstream 2: Governance activity feed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detailed activity feed: highlights of delegation, ownership change, voting, and other governance-related activities</li>\n<li>Real-time API access: surface this data feed real-time via Google Sheets or API - this will enable anyone (delegates, stakeholders, or other builders) to access this information, make visualizations and run pivot tables on top of it.</li>\n<li>Easily accessible delegation and voting data (including historical)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Workstream 3: Research process around KPI tracking</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Week 1: research and interview key stakeholders (delegates, builders, Labs team)</li>\n<li>Week 2-3: design 2-3 methods of tracking and measuring key metrics</li>\n<li>Week 4-6: build MVP of top voted method of tracking</li>\n<li>Week 7-11: deploy, implement and operate the MVP (ideas are only as good as the level of execution)</li>\n<li>Week 12: measure and submit public post on retroactive, learnings and results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We believe that composable advanced features will open up a whole set of new opportunities.

What are some of the key metrics used to evaluate the performance of growth experiment programs?,"Based on the provided information, some key metrics that seem to be used to evaluate the performance of growth experiment programs funded through the Optimism Governance Fund include:

1. User growth and engagement - Several documents mention looking at whether proposals can drive growth in terms of onboarding new users and increasing engagement with the Optimism ecosystem.

2. Capital inflow - One delegate nominee (MoneyManDoug) states that ""Realistically a good grant returns value in the form of users/engagement and capital inflow.""

3. Accountability and transparency - There is an emphasis on grantees demonstrating accountability for how development funds are used, through things like publishing expense sheets, roadmap updates, and open-sourcing work.

4. Alignment with Optimism's mission - Proposals are evaluated on whether they show strong alignment with Optimism's long-term growth and mission. One example question asks ""Has this person shown strong alignment with the long term growth of the Optimism ecosystem and the mission of the Collective?""

5. Measurable results - There seems to be a focus on defining clear, measurable results and impacts created by funded projects, rather than just outputs. One nominee highlights their skills in ""really defining project results.""

So in summary, key metrics appear to include user/capital growth, transparency, mission alignment, and demonstrated measurable results that create value for the Optimism ecosystem.

Are Governance Fund grant applications currently being processed?,"Yes, Governance Fund grant applications are currently being accepted and processed by the Optimism Grants Council.

Based on the information provided, the Optimism Governance Fund is an allocation of OP tokens (5.4% of the initial supply) that is distributed as grants to projects and communities building on Optimism. 

In the early ""Phase 1"" of the Governance Fund, any project building on Optimism could submit a proposal requesting OP tokens, with a plan for how the tokens would incentivize growth on Optimism. These proposals went through a review and voting process by OP token holders and delegates.

However, the process has evolved since then. The most recent information indicates that to get a Governance Fund grant now, projects need to submit an ""Application"" to a ""Mission Request"" which will be evaluated by the Optimism Grants Council or Foundation.

There are guides and documentation, like the ""Get a Grant"" page in the Optimism docs, that outline the current process for applying for and receiving a grant from the Optimism Governance Fund.

Can I create NFTs on the OP Mainnet without knowing how to code?,"Yes, you can create NFTs on the Optimism (OP) Mainnet without knowing how to code. There are several user-friendly platforms and marketplaces that allow you to mint NFTs on Optimism without requiring coding skills. Here are a few options:

1. NFT Marketplaces: Platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, and Foundation support minting NFTs directly on the Optimism network. These marketplaces provide user-friendly interfaces where you can upload your digital artwork, images, videos, or other media, and mint them as NFTs with just a few clicks.

2. No-Code NFT Minting Platforms: Services like Mintable, Nifty Ink, and Tofugnft offer no-code solutions for creating and minting NFTs on various blockchain networks, including Optimism. These platforms typically have drag-and-drop interfaces or simple web-based tools that guide you through the process of creating and deploying your NFTs.

3. Generative Art Platforms: If you're interested in creating generative or algorithmic art NFTs, platforms like Art Blocks and Tezos NFT platforms allow you to mint NFTs on Optimism without coding, using their pre-built smart contracts and user interfaces.

When minting NFTs on these platforms, you'll typically need to connect a web3 wallet (like MetaMask) that supports the Optimism network. You may also need to have some OP tokens (the native currency of Optimism) to pay for gas fees associated with minting and transactions.

It's worth noting that while these no-code solutions make it easier to create NFTs, understanding the basics of NFTs, blockchain technology, and the Optimism ecosystem can be beneficial for a better overall experience.",14.3902907371521,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'General  Discussions ✨ ', 'thread_title': 'Which platform is the best for me to use for NFT deployment directly mintable on Optimism?', 'creation_time': '2024-03-06T04:53:08.101000+00:00', 'username': 'ASTRONAUT', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 0, 'id': '1.7757.34939'}, page_content='<p>Im developing couple unique 3D NFTs &amp; animations videos<br>\nWant to know which platform would be the best to deploy, if I want them to be mintable directly with Optimism token</p>\n<p>I have own contracts on Manifold ETH main-chain<br>\nAnd some collections on Foundation &amp; Opensea minted on IPFS or frozen metadata and Non-Frozen 0nes too<br>\nNot all platforms allow to select specific token<br>\nAnd any particular  recommendation from experience  for Metadata, if I deploy tokens on Optimism?<br>\nSome tokens are huge size and quality &amp; some will be more easier, so peeps can use them In Games directly.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>'), Document(metadata={'path': 'guides', 'document_name': 'nft.md'}, page_content='---\ntitle: Creating an OP Mainnet NFT\nlang: en-US\n---  \nAn NFT ecosystem consists of creators (supply), marketplaces, and buyers/traders (demand) built on top of infrastructures that enable algorithmic generation of art, deployment of smart contracts and access to NFT market intelligence.  \n[Click here for statistics about NFTs on OP Mainnet](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-nft-secondary-marketplaces)'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'ARCHIVED  & OLD Missions', 'thread_title': '[READY] [GF: Phase 1] CRNFT', 'creation_time': '2022-10-24T06:44:45.441000+00:00', 'username': 'crnft', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 1, 'id': '63.3716.15424'}, page_content='<blockquote>\n<p>Hello!<br>\nI have taken a look at your site.

How are protocols selected for the Protocol Delegation Program?,"According to the information provided, protocols are selected for the Protocol Delegation Program based on objective criteria related to their usage and activity on the Optimism network. Specifically:

- The top 15 protocols based on the amount of gas fees they have generated on Optimism are automatically selected to receive token delegations under the program.

- An additional 8 protocol spots are available through a self-nomination process, which allows protocols that did not make the top 15 by gas fees to nominate themselves. The Token House then votes to select these 8 additional protocols.

- Protocols that have previously misused grant funding are not eligible for the program.

The idea is to use objective, quantifiable metrics like gas fees to determine eligibility for most of the program slots, while allowing some flexibility through self-nominations to account for factors that can't easily be standardized.

The program aims to give a voice in governance to protocols that are actively being used on Optimism, without relying too heavily on subjective assessments by the Optimism Foundation. All qualifying protocols must opt-in and agree to participate actively in governance.",11.577008724212646,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Technical  Proposals 📃', 'thread_title': '[DRAFT PROPOSAL]: Protocol Delegation Program', 'creation_time': '2022-12-05T01:55:43.232000+00:00', 'username': 'lavande', 'moderator': True, 'admin': True, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '47.3946.17332'}, page_content='<p>Great to see the active discussion here, you’ve raised a lot of good points that we’d like to address.</p>\n<p>The main goal of this program is to enable protocols with active usage on Optimism to participate in governance without self-delegating grants.

Although protocols may have perceived last season’s voting proposals as relatively uninteresting (an Optimism upgrade and a delegate suspension), they are given two seasons to participate in voting.

If I put myself in the shoes of some of these protocols, who probably don’t have the largest of teams, it seems a bit of a large ask to both be building a great product on optimism AND participating in governance in a meaningful manner. Governance is a full-time job, with some non-obvious best practices. However, we want to give protocols governance power because they are key stakeholders. The best known solution to this problem in general is delegation. Perhaps instead of having to delegate to a protocol, we allow the protocol to select a proxy delegate who represents their interests. That proxy would then receive the delegation on the protocol’s behalf.</p>'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Delegates  🏛', 'thread_title': 'Synthetix Ambassadors Phase 0 Delegation - 2M OP tokens', 'creation_time': '2022-10-19T05:46:24.724000+00:00', 'username': 'states_of_nature1651', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '41.3726.15136'}, page_content='<p>Long time lurker, first time poster.</p>\n<p>I have been following this self-delegation question and it is a super interesting one. I think that there seems to be broad agreement that protocols, especially key ecosystem protocols, should have an active voice in governance. They key questions seem to be 1) Should Optimism be subsidizing this involvement through a grant program designed for ecosystem growth vs. buying their way in and showing that governance has monetary value, 2) How do we protect against overly self-interested behavior, 3) How do we ensure actual governance involvement vs. only focusing on voting for a narrow, specific purpose, and 4) What is an appropriate amount of self-delegation and should the tokens eventually be used?</p>\n<p>This is a tough issue. My thought is that we are using 1 grant program to solve 2 different problems. If there is agreement that protocols need a voice, then it seems like we should have grants/approvals specifically for self-delegation and encourage protocols to apply for OP specifically for that purpose. For example, if we agree that say 50% of vote (just an example) should be protocol voice then it is pretty easy to assign a grant bucket based on current votes. Some benefits:  Protocols could then justify how much they want based on importance/TVL. We could require that they appoint a delegate who should be actively involved based on certain KPIs. Require that they abstain from votes on their own proposals and attach other requirements that make people feel the process is fair. It also allows protocols to choose to participate in governance AND apply for needed funds rather than trying to incorporate both elements into a single proposal. Finally it incentivizes governance participation and as more OP gets delegated will require folks to get more skin in the game to maintain their vote share.</p>\n<p>All this to say, I think 2M OP (10ish % of current votes?) seems about okay for an incredibly important protocol on Optimism. Obviously, it seems like they are participating broadly, but perhaps clearly outlining how Synthetix ambassadors are participating/will participate in governance going forward would outline the value of this specific delegation.</p>')]"
How can DAOs incentivize more thoughtful participation in governance votes?,"DAOs can incentivize more thoughtful participation in governance votes through a combination of mechanisms:

1. Simplicity - Make the voting process as simple and easy to understand as possible. Reduce friction for participation by having clear documentation on how to delegate, vote, and engage in discussions.

2. Compensation/Rewards - Provide economic incentives or rewards for active participation and well-reasoned voting decisions. Some options:

- Retroactive rewards for delegates/voters who made good decisions that benefited the protocol, funded from a governance treasury.
- Multipliers on future airdrops or token rewards for those who actively participate in governance.
- Direct compensation for top delegates based on factors like number of tokens delegated to them and level of engagement.

3. Recognition/Reputation - Non-financial incentives like reputation scores, badges, or ""soulbound"" NFTs that recognize high-quality governance participation can motivate thoughtful voting.

4. User Experience - Invest in professional UX design and analysis to optimize the interfaces and workflows for delegation and voting. Make it extremely easy for token holders to participate.

5. Predictable Incentive Campaigns - Run periodic, predictable campaigns (e.g. quarterly) that incentivize re-delegation to active delegates and voter participation through economic rewards. This creates habits.

6. Measurement & Transparency - Closely measure and publicly share key metrics around voter participation and token delegation. This transparency allows targeting of solutions.

The key is utilizing multiple incentive models - simplicity, economic incentives, reputation, and optimized UX - to reduce barriers and provide motivations for token holders to thoughtfully engage in governance processes over the long-term.",15.328347206115723,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Delegates  🏛', 'thread_title': '[Temp-Check] - Give Incentives to Solve Voters Apathy', 'creation_time': '2022-11-06T15:40:17.215000+00:00', 'username': 'OPUser', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '41.3926.16291'}, page_content='<p>As we are about to ponder around way to improve engagement in our governance, I would like to restart the conversation on solving voter’s apathy.</p>\n<p>I brought this topic on many occasion in the past  [<a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/opuser-delegate-communication-thread/2777/12"">1</a>, <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-to-pause-governance-fund-voting-cycles-till-minimum-viable-decentralization-is-achieved/3215/3"">2</a>], this(<a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/solving-voter-apathy/2964"" class=""inline-onebox"">Solving voter apathy</a>) complete thread by Polynya is dedicated to this topic(highly recommend reading that thread if you havent already).

This is a great thread that thoughtfully highlights a number of areas for improvement moving forward. We’ve noticed that delegate and delegator (token holder) engagement is a recurring theme across both this thread and others. Most other protocols have also faced token holder and delegate apathy, implementing a variety of mechanisms and UX designs in an attempt to solve these issues.</p>\n<p>Voter apathy is a governance problem that crypto may be uniquely suited to address. We offer two primary areas through which to improve voter engagement via delegation. When both areas are addressed, they can have a compounding effect on increasing delegation rates.</p>\n<p><strong>1. User Interface</strong></p>\n<p>The average user should be able to delegate to an active delegate via the simplest workflow possible to encourage delegation. A separate proposal to fund a professional UX design analysis may be appropriate to address this design problem with data-based rigor.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Incentivization</strong></p>\n<p>As others in this thread have addressed, economic incentivization is a powerful tool to encourage user engagement. Many forms of incentivization and funding sources have already been listed in this thread. We will merely add to those suggestions that providing <strong>predictability</strong> is a powerful mechanism to reduce apathy. For example, a short one week campaign to encourage delegation via economic incentives (or re-delegation, if your current delegate is not active) every ~three months provides predictability to voters that is reflected in traditional civic governance models. When token holders only need to pay attention a few times a year, know when those times are and are economically incentivized, they are much more likely to participate.</p>\n<p>After solving for delegation apathy, incentive mechanisms can also increase participation amongst delegates. In addition to the incentivization ideas and recommendations previously listed in this thread, this article from a16z crypto thoroughly explains a mechanism that is intended to get people to honestly report how costly they find it to vote and then pays a defined subset of voters that find voting least costly to actually vote: <a href=""https://a16zcrypto.com/paying-people-to-participate-in-governance/"" class=""inline-onebox"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Paying People to Participate in Governance - a16z crypto</a></p>\n<p>Overall, it’s great to see the depth of feedback here and we are excited to see how Optimism’s governance model continues to evolve.

How can I contribute to translating Optimism's User Docs?,"You can contribute to translating Optimism's User Docs by helping out on their CrowdIn translation platform. Here are the key points:

- Optimism uses CrowdIn (https://crowdin.com/project/optimism-help-center) for community translations of their user documentation.

- You'll need to create a free account on CrowdIn to get started.

- Once logged in, you can select which language you want to translate the docs into and start translating.

- There are different translation roles - proofreaders who approve final translations get higher rewards from Optimism's retroactive public goods funding.

- Optimism takes translations very seriously as part of their goal to make the project accessible and decentralized across diverse global communities.

How can I get involved in running local events for the Optimism community?,"Based on the information provided, it seems Optimism is developing a program called ""Local Optimists"" to support community members in running local events to spread awareness about Optimism. Here are the key points:

1. Optimism recognizes the interest from the community to organize local events and wants to provide better support through the ""Local Optimists"" program.

2. The program is still in development, but you can sign up to be notified when it goes live by filling out this form: https://optimismfnd.typeform.com/local-optimists

3. In the meantime, you can keep an eye on the Optimism website and Discord channel for any updates on when the Local Optimists program launches.

4. There are examples of community members already organizing local events on their own initiative, like the ""Rumbo Optimista - Hacia Ethereum Mexico The Event"" which aimed to connect the local community in Mexico ahead of the Ethereum Mexico 2023 event.

So in summary, while the official Local Optimists program is not live yet, you can express your interest by signing up on the provided form.

How can I participate in general governance discussions for Optimism?,"There are a few main ways you can participate in general governance discussions for Optimism:

1. Join the #gov-general channel on the Optimism Discord server. This is the main channel for having open discussions around governance topics.

2. Participate in the ""General Discussions"" category on the Optimism Governance Forum (gov.optimism.io). You can start new threads or reply to existing ones to engage in governance conversations.

3. Attend the community governance calls that happen every other Tuesday. The schedule is posted on the governance calendar. These calls allow for open discussion on governance matters.

4. If you are a delegate with voting power, you can approve non-grant proposals to move them to a vote by commenting the approval phrase on the proposal thread. You can also vote on live proposals through the governance portal and post your voting rationale.

5. Provide feedback on draft proposals in the ""Proposals Discussion"" section before they go to a vote.

The key is to be active in the designated governance channels on Discord, the Forum, and the community calls.

By fragmenting this to allow for multiple members to vote seperately effects like these can still reflect bases views as a whole, while allowing for a little more granularity when it comes to binary decisions whereby thresholds could be tight between yes/no and rather than just putting 10m OP votes behind a yes, there may be a distribution for say 4m no vs 6m yes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How can we further the Superchain holding true to our values of decentralization and <a href=""https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-neutrality-principles-for-base"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">neutrality</a>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only way to actually achieve this is to push through fraud proofs, sequencer decentralization but also to keep in mind fees. One key aspect people forget is that Crypto is most impactful to those who are unbanked or lack the tools for international payments, and fees are the biggest limiter for real decentralization, because the attach an economic barrier rather than a technical one, which to many cannot be overcome.

Are they voting on some kind of Optimism Foundation mutli-sig, or don’t have such power, if not then where are those funds custodied and/or by whom?</li>\n<li>Do we have an easy way to track/view/understand the “bounce” or success rate of passed proposals being implemented at the discretion of the Foundation? Would any members from the community to be interested to form a working group on such matters so that we could audit the flow of governance in the spirit of both making improvements &amp; boosting transparency?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I guess that I’m suggesting it could be hugely beneficial to create some tooling that makes tracking the <em>off chain</em> implementation / execution of proposals because I’m wanting to participate more actively but finding it difficult to identify the status of many passed proposals.</p>\n<p>The “Governance” category lists “proposal execution” in its description but I could only select rules &amp; processes, voting cycles or delegate updates as filters and delegate updates tag seems inactive.

I’ll post it here to facilitate more serious and constructive discussions:</p>\n<p>Hey team, one big thing that draws me to Optimism is its promise of governance innovation, but currently, i’m not seeing a lot of effort, especially in terms of engaging average users in governance. A voting cycle is a big deal right? But I’m seeing little to no discussion around the proposals from average users (this observation is largely based on my native language channel which is relatively active).   I think one factor that discourages average users from participating is knowledge. It’s not realistic to expect the majority of users(voters) to be techie or financially literate, but imo there’s still a lot that can be done to lower the barrier.  For example, educate the community about some frequently used terminology in the proposal (like ""matching incentives - i have some vague idea but don’t quite understand what it means exactly). Also, maybe share with the community some important criteria when making decisions. Another thing is that the proposals submitted by many projects are not considerate of the average voters at all - “GYSR is a platform for on-chain incentives that’s compatible with any ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens.” - wtf does this mean? (again speaking from the perspective of an average user, not techie, not patient, not dumb) This is not the team’s fault but I think there’s still a lot that can be done to hold those projects to a higher standard in terms of proposals submitted. Another idea is maybe starting an Optimism Governance podcast, inviting the project teams, especially those without a final product, to discuss their efforts and visions (like Optimistic Railway in this voting cycle), or invite two delegates with strong and opposing opinions to debate, etc. There’s no guarantee that these measures will entail better decision-making, but imo these efforts could be a good start and more importantly, demonstrate to the whole Web3 world that Optimism is passionate and optimistic about governance.</p>\n<p><strong>Regarding the facilitation of a more understandable and average voter friendly project proposal,</strong> discord user@PaperImperium seems to have good ideas, and the team could reach out and collaborate:<br>\n<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/9/921c98945b433fc509faec9d7d31bcad21191c6a.png"" data-download-href=""/uploads/short-url/kQyYAYPPFMfDRHDDlBgjLF9SN2G.png?dl=1"" title=""Screen Shot 2022-06-30 at 1.17.23 PM"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc""><img src=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/921c98945b433fc509faec9d7d31bcad21191c6a_2_389x500.png"" alt=""Screen Shot 2022-06-30 at 1.17.23 PM"" data-base62-sha1=""kQyYAYPPFMfDRHDDlBgjLF9SN2G"" width=""389"" height=""500"" srcset=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/921c98945b433fc509faec9d7d31bcad21191c6a_2_389x500.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/921c98945b433fc509faec9d7d31bcad21191c6a_2_583x750.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/921c98945b433fc509faec9d7d31bcad21191c6a_2_778x1000.png 2x"" data-small-upload=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/9/921c98945b433fc509faec9d7d31bcad21191c6a_2_10x10.png""><div class=""meta"">\n<svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#far-image""></use></svg><span class=""filename"">Screen Shot 2022-06-30 at 1.17.23 PM</span><span class=""informations"">1054×1352 201 KB</span><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#discourse-expand""></use></svg>\n</div></a></div></p>\n<p><strong>Discord user <span class=""mention"">@diligit</span> <img src=""https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12"" title="":red_circle:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":red_circle:"" loading=""lazy"" width=""20"" height=""20""><img src=""https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12"" title="":sparkles:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":sparkles:"" loading=""lazy"" width=""20"" height=""20"">#2389 pointed out that podcast might not be a good idea because “Nobody listens to podcasts.”</strong>  I don’t disagree.

It just occurs to me that podcast appears to be a thing on CT (Zero Knowledge,Bankless etc., even CityDao has a podcast dedicated to the project). I guess it’s more of an attention game than the actual number of active listeners.</p>\n<p><strong>And attention game is worth playing.</strong> On one hand there need to be concrete solutions to educate and lower the barrier to governance participation, on the other hand the team needs to put up a show, actively promoting to the wider Web3 world that there’re efforts being made and interesting governance happening here (The recent Maker Dao episodes is actually a good example, ppl discuss it on Twitter. It doesn’t always have to be that dramatic ofc - it can be optimistic). Imo spectatorship is a hidden crucial component of governance. With the show comes the spectators, who are also likely to turn into participants.</p>')]"

How can limiting delegate voting power promote decentralization and new delegate inclusion?delegate,"Limiting the voting power of individual delegates can help promote decentralization and inclusion of new delegates in the following ways:

1. Prevents concentration of voting power: If there is no cap on how many tokens a single delegate can have voting rights over, it can lead to a few delegates accumulating a very large portion of the total voting power. This concentrates decision-making in the hands of a small group. By capping the voting power per delegate, it prevents any one entity from dominating the voting process.

2. Encourages redistribution of voting power: If a delegate hits the voting power cap, they would need to re-delegate any excess tokens to other delegates in order for those tokens to carry voting weight. This naturally redistributes voting power to a wider base of delegates.

3. Lowers barriers to entry for new delegates: With voting power more dispersed, the threshold for a new delegate to gain a meaningful stake becomes lower. This makes it easier for new community members to get involved as delegates.

4. Incentivizes delegate diversity: If delegators want their tokens to have maximum voting influence, they will be incentivized to spread across multiple delegates up to the cap. This promotes having a diverse set of delegate voices and perspectives.

However, voting power caps need to be carefully balanced - if set too low, it could discourage good delegates from participating. The cap level is an important consideration to weigh centralization risks against preserving incentives for high-quality delegates.",14.642282009124756,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Delegates  🏛', 'thread_title': 'Delegate rebalance debate', 'creation_time': '2022-12-27T21:08:25.088000+00:00', 'username': 'Gonna.eth', 'moderator': True, 'admin': False, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 3, 'id': '41.4408.18102'}, page_content='<p>I want to tinker with the idea of limiting delegates voting power to avoid centralization and promote new delegate inclusion and more diverse forum activity.

Pre-distribution metrics can be a parameter, but it will not be applicable to all (this is because many projects deployed with the grant and their distribution is not yet complete) along with their declaration of participation as delegates. These are just criteria ideas to consider.</p>\n<p>You could even think of a previous protocol classification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DeFi</li>\n<li>Bridges</li>\n<li>Games</li>\n<li>Others</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And from there, use one or a maximum of two objective metrics (gas and active addresses, for example, as applicable). The first classification would have to be approved and adjusted by governance, we would recommend doing it through a weighted vote (where each delegate expresses what % of allocation each category deserves, of the total proposed), and the rest according to the results of the metrics taken.</p>\n<p>The limits, participation requirement and code of conduct seem reasonable to be in line with the progress of governance, and not a big change from the current climate.</p>\n<p>One of the points that remain open is how to obtain a diverse participation of protocol representatives in Optimism before large lobbies repel other participation intentions, and at the same time, adjust to the processes that each protocol organization has to follow in order to be able to participate. exercise their work (what is the opportunity cost for a DAO to organize to elect a member dedicated to a possible delegation with potential concrete benefits) that doesn’t discourage the desire to participate in this initiative. Small DAOs or reputable teams could quickly get up to speed but large protocols with governance such as Uniswap or Aave can lead to cumbersome processes.</p>\n<p><strong>In addition</strong>, Optimism should be careful about endorsing representations to protocols that are not legitimate or agreed with the governance/DAO/community or whoever conforms to the protocol set, for example, let’s imagine the following scenario: What happens if a founder decides to participate in the delegation on behalf of the protocol without explicit approval of the protocol (DAO/governance/community)?

How do I apply for a Mission Grant on Optimism?,"To apply for a Mission Grant on Optimism, you need to submit an application to a Mission Request that aligns with your project. Here are the key steps:

1. Check the currently open Mission Requests on the Optimism Governance Forum (gov.optimism.io). Mission Requests outline specific goals or areas that the Optimism community wants to fund projects for.

2. Once you identify a relevant Mission Request, follow the instructions to submit an ""Application"". This typically involves filling out a form or template with details about your project proposal.

3. Your application will be evaluated by the Optimism Grants Council or Foundation based on criteria like impact, feasibility, team expertise etc.

4. If your application is approved, you will be awarded a grant from the Optimism Governance Fund to work on your proposed project and complete specified milestones.

5. The grants are paid out in the OP token, Optimism's governance token. However, the tokens are locked for 1 year before you can access them, except for growth experiment grants which must pass OP directly to end-users.

It's important to note that Mission Grants are for upfront funding of new projects aligned with Optimism's goals. There is also a separate ""Retro Funding"" program for completed projects based on their impact.

The application process aims to be open and transparent through the governance forum. But it can get competitive, so put effort into crafting a strong proposal tied to the specific Mission objectives.",13.224403858184814,"[Document(metadata={'header 2': 'Governance Fund Grant Proposals', 'path': 'governance', 'document_name': 'proposals.md'}, page_content='You can apply for grant funding from the Governance Fund by submitting an [Application](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-applicant-guide-how-to-submit-a-mission-application/6899) to a Mission Request which will be evaluated by theOptimism Grants Council or Foundation.'), Document(metadata={'header 2': 'Phase 2', 'path': 'governance', 'document_name': 'gov-fund.md'}, page_content='Phase 2 will distribute grants that align with Mission Requests.

How do Missions relate to Retro Funding?,"Based on the information provided, Missions and Retro Funding are two separate but complementary mechanisms for supporting contributions to the Optimism ecosystem:

Retro Funding is focused on retroactively rewarding projects and contributions that have already provided positive impact to the Optimism Collective. It allows the Citizens' House to allocate funds to reward past work that benefited the ecosystem.

On the other hand, Missions seem to be a way for the Token House to fund and incentivize specific goals or areas they want to see developed for Optimism going forward. One excerpt mentions that contributions like consumer tools, education initiatives and events that fall outside the scope of upcoming Retro Funding rounds can potentially be supported via Token House Missions.

So in summary:

- Retro Funding rewards past positive impact retrospectively
- Missions fund and incentivize targeted future development goals set by governance

They work in parallel, with Retro Funding focused on recognizing and rewarding prior contributions, while Missions proactively incentivize and support new work aligned with the ecosystem's priorities.

How does a non-grant proposal proceed to a vote in the Optimism Governance Forum?,"For a non-grant proposal to proceed to a vote in the Optimism Governance Forum, it must go through the following process:

1. The proposal author posts the draft proposal as a new thread on the Governance Forum, marking it with [Draft] in the title. This allows the community to provide feedback during Week 1.

2. After incorporating feedback, the author updates the title from [Draft] to [Review] by the end of Week 1. 

3. During Week 2, at least four Optimism delegates, each holding more than 0.5% of the current votable OP token supply, must explicitly approve the proposal in the discussion thread. The delegates cannot approve their own proposals.

4. Once the proposal receives four delegate approvals, the author should update the title from [Review] to [Final] and add a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle Roundup thread by the end of Week 3.

5. In Week 4, the proposal will be included for an on-chain vote via the Optimism Governance Portal. All OP token holders and delegates can participate in this vote.

The key requirements are getting explicit approval from four qualified delegates during the ""Review"" week, and then being included in the Voting Cycle Roundup thread to proceed to the on-chain voting stage in Week 4. This multi-stage process allows for community feedback before delegates review and approve proposals for an actual vote.",15.556419849395752,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Technical  Proposals 📃', 'thread_title': '[DRAFT PROPOSAL]: Moving to a Grants Council', 'creation_time': '2022-11-09T17:48:26.885000+00:00', 'username': 'bobby', 'moderator': True, 'admin': True, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '47.3945.16526'}, page_content='<aside class=""quote no-group"" data-username=""GFXlabs"" data-post=""12"" data-topic=""3945"">\n<div class=""title"">\n<div class=""quote-controls""></div>\n<img loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""24"" height=""24"" src=""https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/gfxlabs/48/171_2.png"" class=""avatar""> GFXlabs:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Given that the OP token has no use other than voting, and will not longer be used for voting very much, is there any thought given to how to continue to support the value proposition of holding OP?

How does the Delta network upgrade propose to reduce L1 costs for OP Chains?,"Unfortunately, the provided information does not seem to contain any details about the Delta network upgrade or how it proposes to reduce L1 costs for OP Chains. The documents discuss topics like:

- A proposal for Bankless Academy to create Optimism-focused educational content
- A discussion about changing OP tokens to be used for gas fees instead of just governance
- General information about transaction fees on Optimism having an L2 execution fee and L1 data fee component
- Questions around whether various hypothetical L3 chains built on Optimism would still be considered part of the ""Superchain"" under the Law of Chains

However, I could not find any mentions of the Delta network upgrade or its proposed mechanisms for reducing L1 costs. Without more relevant information, I cannot provide details on how that specific upgrade aims to lower L1 fees for Optimism chains.

Opening to L3s brings a lot of general issues, because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for many L3s, it may not make sense to run a decentralized sequencing scheme, because revenue may not be that high and the chain may just be an appchain</li>\n<li>I would assume than an L3 <strong>does not</strong> implement a canonical bridge to Ethereum, but to the L2 it settles onto.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More specifically, I think we should be able to answer these questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Are L3s that <strong>settle</strong> on OP Chains still OP Chains?</li>\n<li>Are L3s that <strong>post data</strong> on OP Chains still OP Chains?</li>\n<li>Are L3s that <strong>settle</strong> on non-OP Chains but <strong>post data</strong> on OP Chains still OP Chains?</li>\n<li>Are L3s that <strong>post data</strong> on non-OP Chains but <strong>settle</strong> on OP Chains still OP Chains?</li>\n<li>Are L3s that run a <strong>single-sequencing scheme</strong> still OP Chains?</li>\n<li>Are L3s that run a <strong>single-sequencing scheme</strong>, but <strong>settle</strong> and <strong>post data</strong> on OP Chains, still OP Chains?</li>\n<li>Are L3s that run non-EVM VMs but follow 1. and 2. still OP Chains?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Modularity, hype cycles and narrative cycles can bring very weird modular chains to life. Imagine a new blockchain that launches with this “modular approach”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>OP Stack L3 settling on Arbitrum Orbit, with Celestia underneath, running a decentralized sequencing scheme provided by Espresso, each validator being an AVS with stake provided by EigenLayer with ether.fi-staked eETH tokens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How do we identify an OP Chain in this ‘modular mess’?</p>')]"
How does the Grants Council ensure the responsible allocation of funds?,"Based on the information provided, the Grants Council has several mechanisms in place to ensure responsible allocation of funds from the Optimism Governance Fund:

1. Clear structure and processes:
- The Council is divided into subcommittees (Builders, Growth Experiments, Milestones & Metrics) with specific mandates tied to grant objectives.
- There are defined processes for reviewing grant applications in cycles, with published rubrics that proposers can understand.
- Milestones are worked out with proposers to ensure they are clear, measurable and achievable within timeframes.

2. Expertise and accountability of reviewers:
- Reviewers are elected and expected to have relevant subject matter expertise to evaluate proposals.
- Reviewers are required to maintain high participation rates, document voting rationales, and be accessible to applicants.
- Reviewers are subject to the Code of Conduct and have to re-apply each season.

3. Transparency and community input:
- The Council operations aim to be transparent, with public communication channels.
- Community feedback is solicited and the Council aims to improve processes based on it.
- Non-council token holders can provide oversight due to the high transparency requirements.

4. Milestone tracking and metrics:
- The Milestones & Metrics subcommittee tracks progress on milestones by grantees.
- It also maintains metrics on reviewer performance like comment frequency, attendance etc.

5. Budgeting controls:
- The Council has a defined budget approved by the Token House each season.
- Unallocated funds are returned to the Governance Fund treasury at season end.
- The lead's proposed budget can have variable rewards linked to performance metrics.

So in summary, the division of responsibilities, expertise requirements, transparency, milestone tracking, and budgetary controls are all mechanisms intended to ensure the Grants Council allocates funds responsibly and effectively.",19.92142415046692,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'General  Discussions ✨ ', 'thread_title': 'Big Picture: The Grants Council', 'creation_time': '2024-05-15T20:09:59.624000+00:00', 'username': 'seedlatam', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '1.8154.36896'}, page_content='<p>For the past three seasons, the Grants Council has played a fundamental role in improving governance processes and in setting Optimism as one of the leading Layer 2 solutions.

The Optimism Foundation, aware of the challenges facing the governance structure—ambiguous processes, delegate workload overload, and underlying conflicts of interest—decided to introduce an innovative reform: <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-moving-to-a-grants-council/3945"">The Grants Council.</a></p>\n<p>During <a href=""https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x37fc8a6ae60cff2e4e72fe9c0567f739bb9a78262c2ada236892fcbc7af2c32d"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Special Voting Cycle #9a</a>, the Token House approved the incorporation of the Grants Council and elected its first 8 members. They were organized into two subcommittees: <a href=""https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xdcff47b93fb17a11411bda1809e22cba72e5131d31624e4c0f2b9dbee6811f5c"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Builders</a> and <a href=""https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xa9457a5344747a6c272de786419fc7a4e83fcf0f927ef9b1ce767452faa9b453"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Growth Experiments</a>. While the members were part of the community, the Council leader was selected directly by the Foundation, an external figure with a primarily administrative role and no voting rights on grant approvals.</p>\n<p>Since its beginning, the Grants Council has focused on operational efficiency and transparency. Its main objective was to streamline the proposal selection process, creating a more predictable environment for proposers and setting a regular rhythm in fund distribution. Clear scopes were set, distinguishing Partner Fund operations and improving accountability through milestone-based distributions and smaller-sized grants. This approach not only improved Governance Fund management but also eased the workload of delegates, allowing them to focus on other governance areas.</p>\n<p>Today, the Grants Council continues its initial approach but has evolved to play an even more multifaceted role within Optimism’s governance. With the expansion to three subcommittees—<a href=""https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-13972604474186334"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Builders</a>, <a href=""https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6101609328023982"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Growth Experiments</a>, and <a href=""https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/milestones-and-metrics-sub-committee-missing-48524816566608164"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Milestones and Metrics</a>—and a total of 13 members. This reflects the Optimism Collective’s ongoing commitment to efficient and responsible fund allocation, essential for the sustainable development of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This strategic effort to integrate the grants process within the broader Token House governance framework not only underscores the Council’s commitment to continuous improvement but also ensures a lasting impact on strengthening and growing the Optimism ecosystem.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the Council Structure, Goals and Responsibilities <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-moving-to-a-grants-council/3945"">here</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=""grants-council-the-journey-of-growth-in-optimism-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#grants-council-the-journey-of-growth-in-optimism-3""></a>Grants Council: The Journey of Growth in Optimism</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-season-3-launch/4833"">Season #3</a>: Habemus Grants Council</strong><br>\n<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a.jpeg"" data-download-href=""/uploads/short-url/4Hw152Ibn5GDXHVVwTyMJZJlp0u.jpeg?dl=1"" title=""2"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc""><img src=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_438x375.jpeg"" alt=""2"" data-base62-sha1=""4Hw152Ibn5GDXHVVwTyMJZJlp0u"" width=""438"" height=""375"" srcset=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_438x375.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_657x562.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_876x750.jpeg 2x"" data-dominant-color=""DEBFC2""><div class=""meta""><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#far-image""></use></svg><span class=""filename"">2</span><span class=""informations"">1920×1641 172 KB</span><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#discourse-expand""></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>In this season, the Grants Council came to life, its foundations were laid and its first members were elected.

Since its beginning, we have observed significant changes in fund distribution. In the first two seasons, before the Council was established, fund distribution was disorganized with large amounts of OP tokens allocated to a limited number of applicants. However, with the implementation of the Council in Season 3, the situation improved dramatically: the number of applicants increased by 261.9%, and the number of beneficiaries rose by 54.8%.</p>\n<p>In Season 4, we continued to see progress, with a 101.9% increase in the number of applicants and a 60.41% increase in beneficiaries. The allocated funds increased moderately, by 7.5% compared to Season 3. The positive trend continued in Season 5, where the number of applicants grew by 78.5% and beneficiaries by 68.9%. Additionally, the allocated funds also increased by 47.48% compared to the previous season. It is worth mentioning that in latest season the Grants Council evaluated both the Grants Program and Mission Requests Program.</p>\n<p>Regarding the budget, we can see that each season a portion of the initially approved budget has not been allocated and it was returned to the Government Fund Treasury. This suggests that funds are allocated meticulously and responsibly, avoiding exceeding the initially assigned budget. Similarly, when it was necessary to allocate more budget, such as in Season 4, it was increased by 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>During Cycle 19, out of the 314 applications the Grants Council received, 252 were evaluated by 2 randomly selected reviewers based on the respective subcommittee involved, following the specified rubric. After passing the intake filter, approximately 40 proposals were ultimately approved, including 31 for the builders subcommittee and 12 for the Growth subcommittee. Meanwhile, in Cycle 22, the Grants Council received 234 applications. Out of these, 37 applications were declined during intake, leaving 197 to be evaluated by two randomly selected reviewers, depending on the subcommittee handling the mission request. Among these, 64 proposals were assigned to the builders subcommittee and 26 to the Growth subcommittee.

For the last year and a half I was a grant reviewer at Gitcoin DAO and also lead the decentralized Grant eligibility team there for three seasons. After reviewing over 3000 projects the least I can say is that we and encountered a spectrum of types of extractive behaviors, grant emulations and even hybrid sybil attacks combined with eligibility breaches. Grants that emulate real projects are most def an issue in web3 and the issue is more complex than most people would believe imho.</p>\n<p>The Grants Council has quite the responsability and from what I understand, it’s kinda the oversight board for the future public good projects on Optimism and will possibly strive to ensure a credible neutral  grants program on Optimism. Unfortunately in this <em>red team-blue team</em> scenario, the blue team is always behind in a way while the red team(people, orgs and in the future even nations)that want to extract $) is constantly aware of what the blue team(GC/Optimism in this case) is preparing and adapts its strategies accordingly…</p>\n<p>I am not an expert in the field but I do have some pieces of advice for the GC:</p>\n<p>-one way to combat the red team is to ensure a decentralized committee(Grants Council), this way the interests cannot mix<br>\n-a streamlined process always helps when it comes to grant reviewing<br>\n-documentation needs to be concise, but not overly detailed to ensure that the auditors of the GC can quickly understand what’s going on<br>\n-for <strong>maximum credible neutrality:</strong><br>\n-It would be best if the people on the GC would not know each other prior to the formation of the GC<br>\n-It would be best if the people that do know each other be placed in different committees</p>\n<p>Web3 anti-fraud/efficient capital allocation work is kinda close to my IKIGAI, but I still need to learn the abcs of how Optimism reviews these grant applications and the eligibility criteria.

How does the Optimism Collective support builders with grants?,"The Optimism Collective supports builders with grants in two main ways:

1. Collective Grants
These are upfront grants given in OP tokens for specific projects to be completed in the future. There are two types of Collective Grants:

a) Mission Grants - These grants support projects that align with the Optimism Collective's mission requests or priorities. All Mission Grants have a 1-year token lockup period, except for growth experiment grants which must pass the OP tokens directly to end-users.

b) Partner Fund Grants - The Partner Fund aims to grow the Optimism ecosystem by supporting already successful crypto projects to deploy or scale on Optimism. These can be structured as user incentives (e.g. liquidity mining) distributed directly to users, or as project grants with a 1-year token lockup.

Collective Grants are distributed upon completion of specified milestones and are subject to grant policies set by the Collective.

2. Retro Funding 
These are grants awarded for projects that have already been completed, based on their impact to the Optimism ecosystem.

To apply for grants, builders can fill out an application form or email partnerships@optimism.io depending on the grant type.

How does the bicameral governance system of the Optimism Token House limit the influence of large token holders?,"Based on the information provided, the bicameral governance system of Optimism aims to limit the influence of large token holders through the following mechanisms:

1. The Citizens' House acts as a counterweight to the Token House. While the Token House represents the interests of OP token holders, the Citizens' House is a one-person-one-vote system meant to represent individual human stakeholders like builders, users, and community members aligned with Optimism's long-term vision.

2. The Citizens' House has the ability to veto certain proposals passed by the Token House. For example, the Citizens' House will have a veto right over proposals from the Token House to divert surplus protocol revenue away from public goods funding. This veto power helps guard against the Token House being overly influenced by large token holders pursuing short-term profits over the long-term health of the ecosystem.

3. For key governance powers like protocol upgrades and sequencer selection, both houses must approve - the Token House proposes but the Citizens' House can veto. This system of checks and balances prevents any single constituency, including large token holders, from unilaterally controlling core pieces of the protocol.

4. Citizenship eligibility itself is governed by the Citizens' House, with the Token House having veto power. This prevents large token holders from being able to directly control who becomes a Citizen and has voting power in that house.

So in summary, while large token holders have influence through the Token House voting, their power is balanced and limited by the separate Citizens' House, which has veto rights over certain economic decisions and the ability to block the Token House from unilaterally controlling core protocol parameters or citizenship. The bicameral design aims to give voice to different stakeholders beyond just financial stake.",17.741968870162964,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Delegates  🏛', 'thread_title': 'Top 20% of delegates consolidate 82% of all delegated voting power.

For context, we fully buy into the idea of the collective as a common; which, in turn, requires proper governing for the benefit of all users. We believe that the best way to achieve quality governance is through comparison with existing governance structures and thought.</p>\n<p>In The Politics, Aristotle discusses the typologies of various governments and concludes that the most just form of governance is the “Polity”. We believe that, intentionally or unintentionally, the bicameral legislature of the Optimism Collective is descended from Aristotelian thinking. Aristotle argues that there are essentially two ways in which a government can allocate power to its constituents: by worth and by number. Aristotle’s definition of worth is antiquated–it refers to nobility as well as wealth–but it is still useful in describing the underlying philosophy of the bicameral legislature.</p>\n<p>Those who hold a significant voting share, delegated or owned outright, must be duly considered according to that voting share. If not, there is a significant risk that animosity will develop toward constituents’ allocated votes based on number (the Citizen House). However, as is clear both in history and especially in blockchain, this animosity will lead to more oligarchic governance. We do not believe that Optimism Governance has reached the point of oligarchism. If the top 20% of delegates control 82% of delegated tokens (32MM OP), this only amounts to approximately 11.2% of the circulating supply (~234MM OP).</p>\n<p>Ideally, the Citizen House would be able to check this control, but they only have control over retroactive public goods funding. In The Discourses, Machiavelli, observes that one of the primary reasons for the liberty experienced by the Roman people in the Republican Period was the role of the Tribune of the Plebeians. In short, this was a person who had the ability to veto the actions of the oligarchical upper class, in defence of the people.</p>\n<p>We believe that in order to create the most successful L2 protocol, it would be in the interest of all parties to expand the rights of the Citizen House to include the veto of a proposal, by the majority vote of a quorum of citizens.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that we believe that the citizens should have outright control over the protocol–only that there should be greater checks against the ability to purchase outsized control over the ecosystem. We also believe that it would be beneficial to expand the number of delegates. This would further diversify control among the existing delegates and lead to a more pluralistic Token House.</p>\n<p>Quentin Bazar, Georgetown Blockchain</p>'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Governance  Design 📐', 'thread_title': 'The Future of Optimism Governance', 'creation_time': '2023-07-20T13:09:02.698000+00:00', 'username': 'katie', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 3, 'id': '84.6471.28356'}, page_content='<p>Thank you for the overview, so many exciting updates!

The Token House is made up of OP holders and their delegates, and the Citizens’ House is a one-person-one-vote system based on reputation.</p>\n<p>This two-house design is intended to help the Collective make good decisions and avoid common pitfalls in token-based governance systems. Tokenholders represent one constituency out of many, and are not always the right unilateral owners for decisions that don’t involve the economics of the system. Creating two distinct branches of governance with different membership criteria allows the Collective to match constituents’ incentives with different types of decisions. It also helps the Collective avoid concentration of power, enact safeguards via checks and balances, and evaluate decisions from broader perspectives.</p>\n<p>This is not a new concept. Bi- or tri-cameral governance systems have existed for centuries. With a new iteration of a known pattern, Optimism aims to build a governance system that will stand the test of time and help the Collective flourish.</p>\n<p>This post provides an overview of the goals, design principles, and problem spaces of Optimism Governance. It is not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance processes will be introduced and implemented: it’s highly likely the Collective will learn from initial experiments and make modifications to the rules and processes outlined here. These “Problem Spaces” are intended as starting points for discussion.</p>\n<h2><a name=""governance-goals-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#governance-goals-2""></a>Governance Goals</h2>\n<p>There are two primary goals of Optimism’s governance system:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Capture resistance.</strong> Governance plays a key role in securing the anti-capture and censorship resistance of the Optimism protocol. Governance should (a) make it possible for chain or network operation to continue without reliance on any individual entity, and (b) prevent any one entity or small group of entities from being able to control or censor the protocol or its functions.</li>\n<li><strong>Resource allocation.</strong> Governance’s second primary responsibility is to allocate resources effectively to support the Collective’s vision and accrue sustainable value to the Optimism Collective. Vision &amp; value may often be in conflict, and allocating resources effectively involves a blend of short- and long-term thinking. This includes allocation of both the token treasury and protocol revenue.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=""design-principles-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#design-principles-3""></a>Design Principles</h2>\n<p>Design decisions for the Collective’s governance system should be made in line with three key principles:</p>\n<p><strong>Governance minimization</strong>. The set of governance responsibilities that are encoded onchain or formalized in voting processes should remain as minimal as possible. The Collective aims to reduce governance to its essence and to avoid introducing regulation where freedom can achieve the same result. This principle is key to encouraging permissionless innovation. In practice, this looks like a minimal set of (1) onchain governance processes to upgrade Optimism contracts and tune the economic parameters of the system, and (2) offchain social processes to maintain a healthy community.</p>\n<p><strong>Iteration</strong>. Optimism is decentralizing iteratively to increase the chances of building a healthy system that lasts for the long-term. This means the Foundation will play a role in establishing processes, help the Collective through its first few rapid feedback loops in improving those processes, then reduce its role over time. (This also means the design principles and goals outlined in this document may be invalidated or updated along the way.) This iteration gives the Collective a chance to learn how to make thoughtful decisions using an un-intuitive but essential loop: introduce a governance process that involves active participation, then gradually work to automate or minimize it over time. Governance’s responsibility then becomes to adjust the autopilot when necessary, not to keep two hands on the wheel.</p>\n<p><strong>Forking</strong>. The right to fork and the right to exit are critical to protect individual freedoms. All of the core software and tooling required to run the Optimism network should be made open source, freely available, and easy to use such that a fork is always a viable alternative. This isn’t just about vibes: in crypto, where credible commitments not to extract are <a href=""https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/when-is-decentralizing-on-a-blockchain-valuable/"">what makes decentralized platforms valuable</a>, this is a competitive advantage. Participants will be more likely to join Optimism if they have the ability to make an alternative.</p>\n<p><strong>Balance</strong>. Influence in governance must extend beyond financial stake to value humanhood and intelligent life. The centralizing force of plutocratic token governance must be balanced with Citizenship. Giving voice and power to different constituents allows the Collective to match decisions with voters’ incentives, rather than building a solely plutocratic system. Checks and balances prevent capture.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact = profit.</strong> A key part of the Optimistic Vision is to ensure that every individual is rewarded in proportion to their positive impact to the Collective. We believe this to be the most important target in the pursuit of solving global coordination problems and creating a better future. Our economy is an expression of our collective needs, wants, and ethics. Optimism Governance is ultimately responsible for enacting this fairness ratio that is key to the Optimistic Vision.</p>\n<h2><a name=""design-overview-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#design-overview-4""></a>Design Overview</h2>\n<p>The responsibilities of Optimism Governance can be categorized into one of the two primary goals of the governance system: <strong>Capture Resistance</strong> and <strong>Resource Allocation</strong>. Within each category, governance responsibilities are identified as (a) the exclusive responsibility of one or the other house, (b) a responsibility where one house drives proposals and the other house may veto, or (c) as a truly shared responsibility subject to approval by each house. This system is designed to help each house play to its strengths and avoid deadlock.</p>\n<p>The Optimism <strong>Token House</strong> is made up of OP tokenholders and their delegates. Tokenholders and their delegates are expected to be rational economic actors interested in preserving or increasing the economic well-being of the Optimism Collective. Therefore, the Token House is responsible for decisions that affect business parameters of the system such as inflation or the variables that govern sequencer selection. Token voting is distributed widely and permissionlessly and helps represent the free market in the Collective’s decision making.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the Token House, the <strong>Citizens’ House</strong> uses a one-person, one-vote system. Citizens are meant to represent individual human stakeholders of the Collective: builders, users, and community members who are aligned with the project’s values and are interested in the long-term benefit of the Collective. Therefore, the Citizens’ House is responsible for decisions that may require prioritizing long term growth ahead of other goals – decisions like allocating funding to public goods that support the Collective. In the long term, we can expect the Citizens’ House to expand to include the thousands or millions or billions of humans interacting with Optimism.</p>\n<p>Governance responsibilities given to each house will change over time as the Collective iterates towards its long-term governance-minimized end state. This includes introducing highly manual governance responsibilities (e.g. inflation adjustments, or Superchain allowlists) that are intended to be replaced by automated smart defaults as the Collective learns how to govern these vectors appropriately. It may also include transitioning powers from the responsibility of the full governance body to a subset of governance participants who are empowered by their broader governance base.</p>\n<p>In these early chapters of Collective governance, many of these iterations have been designed or implemented by the Optimism Foundation. Eventually this must transition to the responsibility of Collective governance itself. This meta-governance power marks the end of the Foundation’s stewardship of the evolution of Collective governance and entrusts the governance community with continued experimentation towards a healthy end-state for Optimism.</p>\n<p>So: what does governance… well, govern?</p>\n<h2><a name=""problem-space-1-capture-resistance-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#problem-space-1-capture-resistance-5""></a><strong>Problem Space <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#1:</span> Capture Resistance</strong></h2>\n<p>Optimism Governance’s first responsibility is to ensure that no single party can unilaterally control, censor, halt, or otherwise extract rent from Optimism. A decentralized compute layer is hardly valuable if controlled by a centralized entity. Governance helps the Collective make decisions in the absence of any one person or organization that is “in charge.”</p>\n<p>The responsibility to uphold capture resistance can be broken down into two broad categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>hard powers:</strong> governance powers that are eventually encoded and executed onchain, and</li>\n<li><strong>soft powers:</strong> social norms the governance community upholds, not enforced onchain but by the community’s ability to fork.<br>\n<br></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>1/ Hard powers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Protocol Upgrades</strong> refer to the ability for governance to make changes to the OP Stack protocol itself. This is a crucial responsibility of governance that ultimately makes the community the steward of Optimism’s core protocol functionality.</p>\n<p>Protocol upgrades will be approved by the Token House, subject to a Citizens’ House veto. The Token House is the primary approver because of its broad reach and likelihood of representing business interests that depend on the OP Stack’s functionality. The Citizens’ House veto power guards against capture of the Token House and increases the resilience of the overall system.</p>\n<p>Today, protocol upgrades are approved by the Token House and executed manually by the Optimism Foundation. In the coming Seasons, the Collective may implement a Security Council responsible for executing upgrades following the will of governance. The Citizens’ House veto power comes online in Season 5 (H1 2023), when the Citizens’ House comes fully online. Eventually, execution of protocol upgrades will be fully onchain. On a far enough time horizon, we can expect protocol upgrades to become less and less common as the protocol nears feature completeness. We can look to protocols like Ethereum and Bitcoin as a model for what mature decentralized protocol upgrades look like.</p>\n<p><strong>Sequencer Selection</strong> is the ability to make choices about which parties may act as sequencers for OP Chains or in shared sequencing schemes.</p>\n<p>This begins as an explicit governance power driven by the Token House, with Citizens’ House power to veto. Sequencers are important economic actors for OP Chains and eventually for the Superchain. The Token House is well-incentivized to make sure sequencer selection is fair and beneficial for the Collective. The Citizens’ House veto power guards against the capture of the Token House related to sequencer selection.</p>\n<p>Today, OP Chains are sequenced by a handful of different entities. In Season 5, those sequencers will submit proposals to Optimism Governance to be formally included in the Superchain, officially bringing the hard power of sequencer selection into the hands of the Collective. More information about this governance process will be shared in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Eventually, sequencer selection may be fully automated based on verifiable and pre-agreed upon processes, enabling the sequencer set to be curated and maintained without active governance intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Citizenship Eligibility</strong> is the responsibility of governance to select new humans to participate in the Citizens’ House of Optimism Governance.</p>\n<p>Citizenship Eligibility will be determined by the Citizens’ House; the Token House will have the power to veto. Assuming good long-term values alignment with the Collective, Citizens should be incentivized to grow a set of voters that make quality decisions about RetroPGF allocations. A Token House veto guards against capture of the Citizens’ House or moves to consolidate power.</p>\n<p>To date, Citizenship expansion has been administered by the Foundation. In the future, the Foundation will propose an expansion algorithm that Citizens vote to approve. Ultimately, Citizens may govern a citizenship selection algorithm directly that runs across identity data in the Optimism AttestationStation. In its final minimized form, the Citizens’ House has established a battle-tested onchain selection process; updates to the contracts that govern selection can be made as necessary by the Citizens’ House.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>2/ Soft powers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Code of Conduct Enforcement</strong> is the responsibility of governance to uphold and enforce the Optimism Collective Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>Each house may govern the code of conduct for its own members. The best cultural and values-based enforcement for governance communities should come from within that specific community.</p>\n<p>Today, CoC violations are processed with administration from the Foundation. In future Seasons, the community will iterate on this approach: Season 4 includes an <a href=""https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2"">RFP for Code of Conduct research</a>, and Season 6 may introduce a new Council to replace the Foundation’s role in this process. As a soft power, Code of Conduct enforcement will not be implemented onchain. For example, if a Token House delegate were to violate the Code of Conduct, that delegate would not be prevented from voting by an update to Optimism’s voting contracts onchain. Rather, the community could enforce its rules and norms on the social layer by choosing to remove the participant from delegation frontends and UIs, or by informing the tokenholders who’ve delegated to the offending party of the breach in conduct.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Removal</strong> is the right of governance to remove a director of the Optimism Foundation. Director Removals are approved by the Token House.</p>\n<p>This right is enforced and upheld by the Founding Documents of the Optimism Collective. As such, the Token House may vote to veto any reduction of this power. As Directors are not represented onchain, this responsibility does not have onchain enforceability.</p>\n<h2><a name=""problem-space-2-resource-allocation-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#problem-space-2-resource-allocation-6""></a><strong>Problem Space <span class=""hashtag-raw"">#2:</span> Resource Allocation</strong></h2>\n<p>The second primary responsibility of Optimism governance is to allocate the Collective’s resources to help it achieve its goals. This is a piece of essential governance that requires human intervention, especially in its early stages. Resource allocation in the Collective comes in three forms:</p>\n<p><strong>1/ Allocation of Protocol Revenue</strong><br>\n<strong>2/ OP Treasury Management</strong><br>\n<strong>3/ RetroPGF Funding</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Allocation of Protocol Revenue</strong> is the responsibility of governance to determine how to direct surplus ETH generated by the Optimism protocol. Optimism generates revenue through transaction fees paid on OP Mainnet and other OP Chains. Part of these transaction fees is used to post data to Ethereum L1 and pay for other expenses associated with running the protocol, and the remainder of the fee is accumulated as surplus revenue that can be directed by the Collective for the benefit of the Collective. In the future, the sequencing and proving networks that help run the Optimism protocol may also provide sources of revenue for the Collective.</p>\n<p>By default, surplus protocol revenue will be allocated to RetroPGF. The Token House may vote on proposals to divert a portion of the surplus protocol revenue for other Optimism Collective purposes as they see fit. These proposals will be subject to veto right by the Citizens’ House.</p>\n<p>Protocol Revenue is a crucial lever in the Collective. In its early stages, the default allocation to RetroPGF lets the Collective reward projects that grow the Optimism ecosystem. As Optimism matures, the Token House is entrusted to propose deviations from this default for the health of the Optimism Collective. Citizens’ House veto powers help hold the Token House accountable and prevent short term optimization at the expense of long term sustainability.</p>\n<p>In a future governance season, a proposal type will be introduced for proposing modifications to the allocation of surplus protocol revenue. These proposals may begin with certain safeguards, like a cap on possible allocations. Proposal power for high-level budgeting decisions may additionally be delegated to elected representatives as the Token House sees fit. The long term minimized state of this governance responsibility could include some thoughtful automation to determine revenue allocations based on indicators of whether the Collective should be in a “growth” stage or “value” stage.</p>\n<p><strong>OP Treasury Allocation</strong> is the responsibility of governance to direct how the existing OP token treasury is allocated. This has several components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <strong>Governance Fund</strong>, which is directed by Token House governance.</li>\n<li>The <strong>RetroPGF Fund</strong>, which is directed by Citizens’ House governance, subject to a Token House veto.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Seed Fund</strong> and <strong>Unallocated</strong> portions of the token treasury, which are initially administered by the Foundation, and will eventually be directed jointly by both houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Foundation Budget Approvals</strong>, which are governed jointly by both houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Inflation adjustments</strong>, which are governed by the Token House, subject to a Citizens’ House veto.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This distributed ownership of the OP Treasury allows for flexibility and gives each house a clear mechanism to allocate tokens for the development of the Collective. Today, treasury allocations are administered by the Foundation, and will gradually move onchain as the governance system matures and becomes more resilient. In the long term, as most of the Treasury is circulating, this power will boil down to the governance of inflation, which can be automated to a thoughtful set of defaults based on the economic health of the Collective.</p>\n<p><strong>RetroPGF Grants</strong> are the responsibility of governance to allocate RetroPGF to projects that have provided public good to the Optimism Collective. These grants may refer to either (a) OP tokens from the RetroPGF Fund portion of the token treasury (see OP Treasury Allocation), or (b) Profits generated by the Optimism Protocol that governance has decided to allocate to RetroPGF (see Allocation of Protocol Revenue). Specifically, this responsibility includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>RetroPGF Scope</strong>: the ability of governance to update the scope, metrics, and impact evaluation criteria used in determining how RetroPGF Grants are allocated to projects. In line with the principle of governance minimization, this should be a soft power.</li>\n<li><strong>Project Allocations</strong>: the ability of the Citizens’ House to make specific individual project-level decisions about how the RetroPGF Scope is applied to allocate grants. This is the corresponding hard power for RetroPGF.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both components of RetroPGF Grants above are the responsibility of the Citizens’ House. Citizens are selected as individual humans who are interested in the long term health of the Optimism Collective, and RetroPGF is a long term investment in Optimism’s growth.</p>\n<p>Today, the Foundation identifies RetroPGF scope and Citizens make Project Allocation decisions. Eventually, Citizens will govern RetroPGF scope themselves.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Altogether, this looks like the diagram below:</p>\n<p><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339.png"" data-download-href=""/uploads/short-url/caEzKbwfX1MMuFTjinRTEdM3vVD.png?dl=1"" title=""""><img src=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_690x345.png"" alt="""" data-base62-sha1=""caEzKbwfX1MMuFTjinRTEdM3vVD"" width=""690"" height=""345"" role=""presentation"" srcset=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_690x345.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_1035x517.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/554e68d3e42f4b625fb54008e734c35c4b971339_2_1380x690.png 2x"" data-dominant-color=""23212B""><div class=""meta""><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#far-image""></use></svg><span class=""filename""></span><span class=""informations"">3840×1921 572 KB</span><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#discourse-expand""></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<h2><a name=""additional-notes-7"" class=""anchor"" href=""#additional-notes-7""></a>Additional Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Incompleteness</strong></p>\n<p>The list above does not include all governance powers – it notably excludes governance responsibilities, especially social ones.</p>\n<p>The list above is also not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance powers will be rolled out and implemented.

In particular, it’s important to note that all veto powers are not created equal. A very high veto threshold and quorum create a higher bar for exercising veto power, where a simple majority could make for a relatively easy veto. These thresholds determine the balance of power in responsibilities shared between houses and must be considered carefully.</p>\n<p>The Collective will apply the principle of iteration in introducing these checks, balances, and vetos. This allows time to experiment with the right settings and make sure both branches of governance are developing safely.</p>\n<p>These details are incredibly important to the design of a well-functioning system, and members of the Collective are consulting with a set of experts, from crypto and beyond, to design a quality set of patterns to increase the chances of Optimism Governance’s success. If you’re interested in contributing to these efforts, you’re welcome to reach out to <a href=""http://mailto:bobby@optimism.io/"">bobby@optimism.io</a> or chime in on the governance forums.</p>\n<p><strong>Citizenship and capture</strong></p>\n<p>Since Citizens play a crucial role in the Optimism governance, it’s paramount that the Citizens’ House is qualified and capture-resistant. Several factors come into play here, including the ways identity and contribution history can help inform citizenship eligibility; public and private voting strategies to help prevent collusion and bribery; citizenship incentives; escape hatches and metagovernance in the event of capture; and the iterative path towards growing the set of Citizens and their responsibilities.

How has the votable supply of OP tokens changed during Season 3?,"Based on the information provided, there are no direct details about how the votable supply of OP tokens changed specifically during Season 3 of Optimism governance. However, I can provide some relevant context:

The votable supply refers to the total amount of OP tokens that have been delegated to non-zero addresses for voting purposes. This excludes undelegated tokens held by the Optimism Foundation, investors, etc.

One post mentions that as of Season 2, there had been 87 Token House votes, implying the votable supply was being actively used for on-chain governance votes.

Another post from September 2023 states that increasing the votable supply and governance engagement are ""crucial steps on the path to decentralization and a self-sustaining ecosystem."" This suggests the Optimism team was still working to grow the votable supply over time.

However, there are no specifics provided about the actual size of the votable supply during Season 3 or how much it may have increased or decreased compared to prior seasons.

The votable supply is an important metric for Optimism's governance process, as it represents the actual tokens that can participate in voting. But the documents do not contain clear data on its precise level during Season 3. Tracking the votable supply over time would require analyzing on-chain data or updates directly from the Optimism team.",13.00849986076355,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Technical  Proposals 📃', 'thread_title': '[DRAFT PROPOSAL]: Protocol Delegation Program', 'creation_time': '2022-11-09T04:38:15.920000+00:00', 'username': 'polynya', 'moderator': False, 'admin': False, 'staff': False, 'trust_level': 2, 'id': '47.3946.16462'}, page_content='<aside class=""quote no-group quote-modified"" data-username=""system"" data-post=""1"" data-topic=""3946"">\n<div class=""title"">\n<div class=""quote-controls""></div>\n<img loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""24"" height=""24"" src=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png"" class=""avatar""> system:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A total of 8M OP (or no more than 1/3 of the votable supply as of the start of each Season) would be delegated across 20 protocols, using idle tokens in the Other Initiatives category of the Governance Fund.

The Optimism Foundation, aware of the challenges facing the governance structure—ambiguous processes, delegate workload overload, and underlying conflicts of interest—decided to introduce an innovative reform: <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-moving-to-a-grants-council/3945"">The Grants Council.</a></p>\n<p>During <a href=""https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x37fc8a6ae60cff2e4e72fe9c0567f739bb9a78262c2ada236892fcbc7af2c32d"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Special Voting Cycle #9a</a>, the Token House approved the incorporation of the Grants Council and elected its first 8 members. They were organized into two subcommittees: <a href=""https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xdcff47b93fb17a11411bda1809e22cba72e5131d31624e4c0f2b9dbee6811f5c"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Builders</a> and <a href=""https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xa9457a5344747a6c272de786419fc7a4e83fcf0f927ef9b1ce767452faa9b453"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Growth Experiments</a>. While the members were part of the community, the Council leader was selected directly by the Foundation, an external figure with a primarily administrative role and no voting rights on grant approvals.</p>\n<p>Since its beginning, the Grants Council has focused on operational efficiency and transparency. Its main objective was to streamline the proposal selection process, creating a more predictable environment for proposers and setting a regular rhythm in fund distribution. Clear scopes were set, distinguishing Partner Fund operations and improving accountability through milestone-based distributions and smaller-sized grants. This approach not only improved Governance Fund management but also eased the workload of delegates, allowing them to focus on other governance areas.</p>\n<p>Today, the Grants Council continues its initial approach but has evolved to play an even more multifaceted role within Optimism’s governance. With the expansion to three subcommittees—<a href=""https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-13972604474186334"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Builders</a>, <a href=""https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6101609328023982"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Growth Experiments</a>, and <a href=""https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/milestones-and-metrics-sub-committee-missing-48524816566608164"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Milestones and Metrics</a>—and a total of 13 members. This reflects the Optimism Collective’s ongoing commitment to efficient and responsible fund allocation, essential for the sustainable development of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This strategic effort to integrate the grants process within the broader Token House governance framework not only underscores the Council’s commitment to continuous improvement but also ensures a lasting impact on strengthening and growing the Optimism ecosystem.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the Council Structure, Goals and Responsibilities <a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-moving-to-a-grants-council/3945"">here</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=""grants-council-the-journey-of-growth-in-optimism-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#grants-council-the-journey-of-growth-in-optimism-3""></a>Grants Council: The Journey of Growth in Optimism</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=""https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-season-3-launch/4833"">Season #3</a>: Habemus Grants Council</strong><br>\n<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a.jpeg"" data-download-href=""/uploads/short-url/4Hw152Ibn5GDXHVVwTyMJZJlp0u.jpeg?dl=1"" title=""2"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc""><img src=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_438x375.jpeg"" alt=""2"" data-base62-sha1=""4Hw152Ibn5GDXHVVwTyMJZJlp0u"" width=""438"" height=""375"" srcset=""https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_438x375.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_657x562.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_876x750.jpeg 2x"" data-dominant-color=""DEBFC2""><div class=""meta""><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#far-image""></use></svg><span class=""filename"">2</span><span class=""informations"">1920×1641 172 KB</span><svg class=""fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon"" aria-hidden=""true""><use href=""#discourse-expand""></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>In this season, the Grants Council came to life, its foundations were laid and its first members were elected.

Since its beginning, we have observed significant changes in fund distribution. In the first two seasons, before the Council was established, fund distribution was disorganized with large amounts of OP tokens allocated to a limited number of applicants. However, with the implementation of the Council in Season 3, the situation improved dramatically: the number of applicants increased by 261.9%, and the number of beneficiaries rose by 54.8%.</p>\n<p>In Season 4, we continued to see progress, with a 101.9% increase in the number of applicants and a 60.41% increase in beneficiaries. The allocated funds increased moderately, by 7.5% compared to Season 3. The positive trend continued in Season 5, where the number of applicants grew by 78.5% and beneficiaries by 68.9%. Additionally, the allocated funds also increased by 47.48% compared to the previous season. It is worth mentioning that in latest season the Grants Council evaluated both the Grants Program and Mission Requests Program.</p>\n<p>Regarding the budget, we can see that each season a portion of the initially approved budget has not been allocated and it was returned to the Government Fund Treasury. This suggests that funds are allocated meticulously and responsibly, avoiding exceeding the initially assigned budget. Similarly, when it was necessary to allocate more budget, such as in Season 4, it was increased by 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>During Cycle 19, out of the 314 applications the Grants Council received, 252 were evaluated by 2 randomly selected reviewers based on the respective subcommittee involved, following the specified rubric. After passing the intake filter, approximately 40 proposals were ultimately approved, including 31 for the builders subcommittee and 12 for the Growth subcommittee. Meanwhile, in Cycle 22, the Grants Council received 234 applications. Out of these, 37 applications were declined during intake, leaving 197 to be evaluated by two randomly selected reviewers, depending on the subcommittee handling the mission request. Among these, 64 proposals were assigned to the builders subcommittee and 26 to the Growth subcommittee. This data was gathered from the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ul8iMTsOFUKUmqz6MK0zpgt8Ki8tFtoWKGlwXj-Op34/edit#gid=970075255"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Optimism GovFund Grants: Public Delivery Tracking</a>.

We also suggest that this subcommittee have its own framework, schedule and timeline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As we saw, the number of applicants increases each season, and to maintain this momentum while assisting diverse groups of developers, communities, and protocols in applying to the Grants Program and Mission Requests Program, we suggest establishing a broader marketing and communications task force. Perhaps <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/katie"">@katie</a>, who led communications for the Grants Council, can provide insights on whether this makes sense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We also believe that a working group could be established to provide initial feedback on proposals; this group would ensure that proposals meet the template and established requirements. The idea of this group is to alleviate the workload of reviewers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are just a few suggestions that we’re sharing so we can continue iterating together.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional resources</strong><br>\n<a href=""https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Optimism-Grants-Council-Season-3-090bb648d1854136b9630c608da7a8bc"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Grants Council charmverse - Season #3<br>\n</a><a href=""https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/season-4-old-optimism-grants-council-701220845245208"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Grants Council charmverse - Season#4<br>\n</a><a href=""https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/optimism-grants-council-8323028890716944"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Grants Council charmverse- Season#5</a></p>'), Document(metadata={'header 2': 'Phase 1', 'path': 'governance', 'document_name': 'gov-fund.md'}, page_content='Phase 1 distributed grants to projects in the Optimism ecosystem.\nYou can see how Phase 1 grants have been distributed to date in [the Governance Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eaHOlWB34ij1KGsXdaNyTQg4tt1Pu2JurJsElBb6a8k/edit#gid=0).  \nWhen a project gets a proposal approved, they are still eligible to apply for further proposals.\nProjects are also encouraged to reference data from the success of their initial distribution to strengthen their case in future proposals.'), Document(metadata={'header 2': 'History', 'header 3': 'Season #1', 'path': 'governance', 'document_name': 'token-house-history.md'}, page_content='* [Voting cycle #4](https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-4-roundup/3055)\n* [Voting cycle #3](https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-3-roundup/2923)\n* [Voting cycle #2](https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-2-roundup/2754)\n* [Voting cycle #1](https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-1-roundup/2619)'), Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Updates  and Announcements 📢', 'thread_title': 'Governance Update #2', 'creation_time': '2022-07-21T18:43:50.515000+00:00', 'username': 'ben-chain', 'moderator': True, 'admin': False, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '48.3056.10500'}, page_content='<h2>\n<a name=""voting-underway-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#voting-underway-1""></a><strong>Voting Underway</strong>\n</h2>\n<p>Optimism’s Token House is up and running!

To understand what’s working and what’s not, we’ve been collecting feedback from proposal authors, delegates, and other members of our community. We’ve heard a few common themes:</p>\n<p><strong>There are too many proposals to review.</strong> In our current governance structure, every project proposal is put up for a vote by the entire Token House. The Governance Fund received dozens of proposals in the first two voting cycles alone. Ideally, each proposal gets feedback before voting begins; with so many individual votes, this is hard to make happen.</p>\n<p><strong>There’s no time between voting cycles</strong>. Voting cycles run every two weeks. Cycles begin on Thursday at 7p GMT and end 13 days later on Wednesday at 7p GMT. Our hypothesis was that proposal authors would leave their submissions in “draft” mode until they’d received feedback, then submit to a voting cycle when ready. Instead, we’re learning that authors submit to a voting cycle even if they’re received minimal feedback – there are no guidelines suggesting otherwise! This means many delegates both review and vote within the same two week period and don’t have time to get to the incoming “draft” proposals.</p>\n<p><strong>Some proposals don’t have enough background info.</strong> Delegates aren’t familiar with every project submitting a proposal. While some proposals come from well-known crypto projects, others come from smaller or more specific projects unknown to many delegates. In order to evaluate proposals well, delegates have expressed the need for better context-setting and background info, or more time for research.</p>\n<p><strong>Communication channels are challenging.</strong> Our governance process spans Discord, Discourse, and Snapshot. Community members have expressed confusion or frustration at having to track conversations across multiple platforms <img src=""https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/hot_face.png?v=12"" title="":hot_face:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":hot_face:"" loading=""lazy"" width=""20"" height=""20""></p>\n<p><strong>Some parts of the governance process are underspecified.</strong> v0.1 governance process as defined in the Operating Manual lacks clear instructions on a few situations that have come up in the first two voting cycles: how to re-submit a proposal which previously passed, rules around conflicts of interest, and precise submission deadlines.</p>\n<p><strong>Lack of alignment on Governance Fund scope.</strong> Our <a href=""https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/"">governance documentation</a> says the Governance Fund exists to encourage the “proactive growth of the Optimism ecosystem,” and there is a distinct allocation of OP for public goods funding. Nevertheless, there’s still plenty of room for interpretation of “proactive growth.” Should the GovFund be used to compensate development teams? Can closed-source projects apply for funding? Can some public goods be considered as promoting proactive growth despite the separate bucket? There’s been good discussion on these and similar questions in the Discord.</p>\n<h2>\n<a name=""gov-fund-guidelines-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#gov-fund-guidelines-3""></a>Gov Fund Guidelines</h2>\n<p>As Governance Fund grants are approved are distributed, our community has raised questions about individual projects’ use of the tokens they receive.</p>\n<p>Teams who receive grants from the Governance Fund <strong>must be able to account for all transactions that touch any portion of their grant funds</strong>. And while this may be obvious, we expect no self-dealing. If any expenditure can be construed as self-dealing, we expect the team to be clear about this in advance and include why it’s <em>not</em> self-dealing. Withdrawals of the grant from the Optimism network should also be clearly stated and justified.</p>\n<p>We’re grateful to our community for holding projects accountable to their proposals. Accountability will be a core focus of future governance process iterations.</p>\n<h2>\n<a name=""whats-next-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#whats-next-4""></a>What’s Next</h2>\n<p><strong>Season 1</strong> of Optimism Collective governance is coming to a close. What does this mean?</p>\n<p>The Optimism Foundation is working with delegates and community members to shape a set of process upgrades that improve our governance based on the feedback above.

Is there any reward for translating documents for Optimism?,"Yes, there are rewards for translating documents for Optimism. According to the information provided:

1. In the ""Education nominations for RPGF2"" thread, it mentions that Optimism has been rewarding translators who contributed to translating the Optimism user documentation on the Crowdin platform. Specifically, it states that ""Proofreaders"" who approved translations on Crowdin will be considered for rewards in a 2:1 ratio compared to translators of articles/tweets.

2. The thread provides a link to a Google Sheet listing the translators who will be considered for rewards from this nomination.

3. It also mentions that going forward, a more structured translation program will be rolled out to provide sufficient rewards for translators.

So in summary, Optimism has been rewarding community members who helped translate the official user documentation, especially those who acted as proofreaders on the Crowdin platform. And they plan to overhaul the translation program later to continue incentivizing and rewarding translation efforts in a more structured way. The rewards are distributed in the form of the OP governance token.",12.254917860031128,"[Document(metadata={'path': 'contribute/contribution-path', 'document_name': 'translators.md'}, page_content='---\ntitle: Translators\nlang: en-US\n---  \nAt Optimism, we know that we can never truly decentralise if we do not embrace the diversity of our community.

What accountability measures are in place for teams receiving grants from the Governance Fund?,"There are a few key accountability measures in place for teams receiving grants from the Optimism Governance Fund:

1. Public Reporting Requirements: Grant recipients agree to reporting requirements when applying for a grant. This includes providing details on how the grant funds are being used and distributed. Proposed reporting fields include details on OP token distributions/incentives, internal OP transfers, grants given out by the recipient project, milestones achieved, and overall grant progress updates.

2. Public Forum Updates: Grant recipients are expected to provide public updates on their progress and use of funds on the Optimism Governance Forum under the ""Grant Updates"" category. This allows the community and delegates to scrutinize how grants are being utilized.

3. Milestone Tracking: Major grant disbursements are tied to the completion of specific project milestones. The Grants Council tracks and verifies milestone completions before approving further fund releases.

4. Feedback for Future Funding: Projects must provide feedback on their prior use of grant funds before being approved for additional funding from the Governance Fund. This incentivizes accountability.

5. Flexible Requirements: While thorough reporting is expected, the requirements aim to avoid excessive bureaucracy that could overburden smaller projects. Requirements may be scaled based on the grant size and project needs.

The overall goal is to create transparency into how governance funds are deployed, while avoiding overly burdensome processes that could deter projects from building on Optimism. Delegates and the community play an active role in monitoring and providing oversight on grant accountability.",13.969202041625977,"[Document(metadata={'board_name': 'Accountability  🗂️', 'thread_title': 'About the Monitoring category', 'creation_time': '2023-03-21T15:47:20.785000+00:00', 'username': 'system', 'moderator': True, 'admin': True, 'staff': True, 'trust_level': 4, 'id': '62.5704.24307'}, page_content='<p>This category is for posts that increase transparency and accountability.</p>\n<p>Specifically transparency and accountability around the usage of Governance Fund grants or other topics relevant to members of the Collective.</p>\n<p>Please keep the information provided here factual.

It’s in the project’s interests to just keep slowly giving us nuggets of information we request, and otherwise keep pumping out the same reports they’re providing for every chain, to keep costs down. And then is the idea that every delegate must keep track of this feedback and scrutiny, and bare it all in mind for the next proposal? That’s a lot of extra work on all sides.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, imagine asking for quarterly reports from the small project providing a valuable service on Optimism only that’s difficult to monetise other than for RPG funding. Setting a prescriptive reporting standard may mean that they’re draining a decent chunk of their funding just on the cost of reporting. Or accepting that reporting could scale with the organisation, the little project may really only be able to say “here are our current financials and stats, all of our funding comes from RPG funding”. If that’s the case, then would we just accept a dashboard page on their site that shows the current state of their operations and finances? And if so, what’s to stop bigger projects taking the same approach? It feels like we may get so bogged down in figuring out the correct approach to accountability that we lose sight of the bigger picture - the little project doesn’t need much and is doing important things, so we don’t really need much accountability from it.</p>\n<p>The synthesis that I’m reaching is that the larger and more complicated our approach to accountability becomes, the more it’s likely to damage the effectiveness of our RPG funding program. Some accountability may be of benefit, but we should aim for this to be flexible and accommodating to the needs of the recipient. We should also aim to make it manageable and easily digestible for our delegates, to keep the funding process light and accessible. Perhaps I’d suggest to start with that projects need to give feedback on their use of funds already received before they can receive more funds… that at least provides an incentive to give good feedback.</p>'), Document(metadata={'header 2': 'Governance Fund Grant Proposals', 'path': 'governance', 'document_name': 'proposals.md'}, page_content='You can apply for grant funding from the Governance Fund by submitting an [Application](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-applicant-guide-how-to-submit-a-mission-application/6899) to a Mission Request which will be evaluated by theOptimism Grants Council or Foundation.')]"
