gpt-4o-mini,What is required for a non-grant proposal to move to a vote in the Optimism governance process?,"
For a non-grant proposal to move to a vote in the Optimism governance process, it must receive approval from four of the top 100 delegates. This requirement ensures that there is sufficient support among key stakeholders before a proposal is considered for voting. In contrast, proposals initiated by the Foundation do not need this approval to proceed to a vote [1][2].

gpt-4o-mini,What is required for a proposal to move to a vote in the Optimism governance process?,"
For a proposal to move to a vote in the Optimism governance process, it must first undergo community feedback and delegate feedback phases. After these discussions, the proposal enters a voting period. This process is part of a structured three-week cycle, ensuring that all stakeholders have the opportunity to evaluate and discuss the proposal before it is voted on. The Optimism Foundation oversees this process and implements the approved proposals [1][2].

gpt-4o-mini,What is the purpose of the Code of Conduct Council?,"
The purpose of the Code of Conduct Council (CoCC) is to manage violations of the community's code of conduct within the Optimism governance framework. It aims to decentralize the handling of these violations, taking enforcement responsibilities away from Token House delegates. The council seeks to provide a structured and transparent approach to addressing misconduct, although there are ongoing discussions about its effectiveness and the need for clearer guidelines and processes for reporting violations [1][2][3][4].
