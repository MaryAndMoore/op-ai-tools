This method simplifies the decision-making process and aims to improve how funds are allocated to various projects. Feedback from earlier implementations has led to suggestions for enhancements, such as better categorization of projects and features that improve user experience, like an undo option and the ability to give zero tokens to projects. The system is designed to ensure fair evaluations and effective distribution of funds within the community [1][2][3][4][5].\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://gov.optimism.io/t/pairwise-community-signaling-in-retro-funding-4-no-badge-required/8091\n[2] https://gov.optimism.io/t/pairwise-retrospective-and-proposed-spec-for-retropgf-4/7479\n[3] https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-experimentation-voting-algorithms/7216\n[4] https://gov.optimism.io/t/promoting-transparency-and-accountability-by-making-retropgf-badgeholder-votes-public/6436\n[5] https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-community-call-recaps-recordings-thread/6937\n",

The recent shift in Retro Funding to narrow scoped rounds aims to provide clearer criteria for funding, which could influence the types of Missions that are prioritized and funded. This means that while Missions are focused on specific proposals, Retro Funding will now be more targeted, potentially affecting which projects receive financial support based on their alignment with the new funding criteria [1][2][3].\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-roundup/6206  \n[2] https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-4-alliance-guide/5873  \n[3] https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-moving-from-broad-to-narrow-scoped-rounds/7759  \n",
