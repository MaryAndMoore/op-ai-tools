This structure ensures that large token holders do not have disproportionate influence over governance decisions. The Citizens' House acts as a counterbalance to the Token House, promoting broader participation and reducing the risk of wealth translating into power.

The funding is guided by the principle of \"impact = profit,\" which means that contributors are rewarded in proportion to the positive value they have created for the community. The evaluation of projects is categorized into areas such as governance, developer ecosystem, and user experience [1].\n\nThe process involves multiple rounds where projects can apply for funding, and community members, referred to as badgeholders, participate in voting to decide which projects receive support. Ongoing discussions aim to enhance the transparency and fairness of the voting mechanisms and criteria used for project evaluation [1][2].\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-impact-profit-framework/7034\n[2] https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-moving-from-broad-to-narrow-scoped-rounds/7759\n",

Many community members have expressed skepticism about the processes for reporting and handling violations, advocating for a more transparent and efficient system. There are calls for the establishment of a Code of Conduct Council to manage these issues, particularly highlighted in discussions about specific violations, such as a doxxing claim, where opinions were divided on the validity of the claim and the evidence provided [1][2]. Additionally, concerns about conflicts of interest and potential cronyism in governance decisions have been raised, emphasizing the need for clearer policies and better disclosure practices [3][4].
