The core principle guiding these rounds is \"impact = profit,\" which means that contributors are compensated based on the positive impact they have made for the community, rather than on their future potential or the effort they put in. This system emphasizes the importance of transparency and accurate reporting to ensure fair evaluations and funding allocations.\n\nRecently, there has been a shift in the RetroPGF process from broad to narrow scoped rounds. This change is intended to enhance clarity and predictability for builders, allowing for better measurement of impact and more targeted funding [1][2].\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://gov.optimism.io/t/about-the-retro-funding-category/4697\n[2] https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-pgf-impact-profit-framework/7034\n",

                "answer": "\nCommunity concerns regarding the enforcement of the Code of Conduct in Optimism governance primarily focus on the need for clearer guidelines and less severe penalties for violations. Some members fear that strict enforcement could discourage transparency and have called for better definitions of conflicts of interest. Suggestions have included using temporary suspensions or warnings instead of removing voting badges outright. There is also a push for a more decentralized approach to handling conflicts of interest and requests for clarity on how suspended badges can be reinstated. Additionally, specific cases, such as allegations of doxxing, have raised concerns about the fairness of the enforcement process and the potential for it to silence whistleblowers [1][2][3][4].\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-conflicts-of-interest-season-5-citizens/7506  \n[2] https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-violation-carlos-melgar/6882  \n[3] https://gov.optimism.io/t/nownlater309-observation-of-c-o-c-violation/7280  \n[4] https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-update-8/7039  \n",
