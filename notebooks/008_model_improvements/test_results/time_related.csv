What happens if i submit a proposal after the cycle deadline?,Any Application submitted after a Cycle deadline will be considered for the next Cycle.,"
If you submit a proposal after the cycle deadline, it will not be considered for that voting cycle. You would need to wait for the next cycle to submit your proposal. This has been the case in previous cycles, where late submissions were advised to be resubmitted in the following cycle [1][2].

If you submit a proposal after the cycle deadline, it will generally not be considered for that specific cycle. For instance, a past proposal was submitted after the deadline, and the moderator indicated that the deadline had passed, advising the proposer to explore other grant options [1]. Therefore, it is important to adhere to submission deadlines to ensure your proposal is reviewed.
