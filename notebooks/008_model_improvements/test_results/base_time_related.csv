What unique skills or habits will you bring to the Code of Conduct Council to ensure it delivers measurable impact towards the approved KPIs?","
The CoCC town hall operates as a forum for discussing and addressing issues related to the Code of Conduct within the Optimism governance community. It involves a structured process for handling reports of violations, which includes notification, investigation, and decision-making phases. Members of the council are responsible for participating in votes and ensuring accountability through documentation of their proceedings. The council aims to enhance transparency and community involvement in its decisions [1][2].

In Season 6, the CoCC will continue to enforce the Rules of Engagement, and its operating budget will be determined through a voting process among delegates. This renewal process allows for community input and aims to ensure that the council remains effective and accountable [3][4].
