      "\"106\", \"How can limiting delegate voting power promote decentralization and new delegate inclusion?\", \"Limiting delegate voting power can prevent centralization by ensuring that no single delegate has excessive influence. This encourages token holders to redelegate their tokens to other delegates, promoting a more diverse and active community.\"\n",
      "\"106\", \"What are some potential drawbacks of implementing a delegate voting cap?\", \"One potential drawback is that large delegates might reroute their 'extra' voting power to other addresses they control, which could undermine the goal of decentralization. Additionally, any modification to voting power must respect the original token holder's delegation to avoid delegitimizing the governance process.\"\n",
      "\"106\", \"What are some alternative ideas to promote delegate diversification without sub-delegation?\", \"Alternatives include creating specific delegate positions for different niches or removing/filtering delegates above a certain threshold from the delegates' frontend page. These methods aim to limit the growth of delegates with too much voting power and encourage more active participation from a broader range of delegates.\"\n",
      "\"106\", \"Why is it important to respect the token holder's delegation in any voting power modification?\", \"Respecting the token holder's delegation is crucial because it maintains the legitimacy of the governance process.

The new proposal can then go through the review and voting process again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"115\", \"Is there a potential conflict between OP holders' incentives and Optimism's mission to reduce transaction fees?\", \"Some users believe there is a potential conflict because OP holders might benefit from higher transaction fees, which contradicts Optimism's goal of reducing fees. However, others argue that OP's value is primarily derived from its governance utility, not transaction fees.\"\n",
      "\"115\", \"How are transaction fees on Optimism currently paid, and does this impact OP holders?\", \"Transaction fees on Optimism are paid in ETH, not OP. This means that the direct financial incentive for OP holders is not tied to transaction fees, but rather to governance and the overall success of the ecosystem.\"\n",
