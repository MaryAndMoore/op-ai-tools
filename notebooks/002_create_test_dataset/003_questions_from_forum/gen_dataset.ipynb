Avoid questions that are too silly or not about optimism, that are not well answered by the fragment or that could be done just by someone who knows the documentation already. Try to avoid repetitive questions, and ask only things that could really be asked by an user (it is ok to do just one or even zero questions if there are not many important stuff in the fragment).

For example, if the attestation will be used immediately for a purpose like attestation-gated channels in Discord, it solves a real need or problem.\"\n",
      "\"39\", \"What should you consider if you're unsure about issuing an attestation?\", \"If you're unsure about issuing an attestation, consider the importance of the information in the context of the value chain it is part of. For instance, in Retro Funding, the fact that a project received funding is more valuable than the fact that it merely applied.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"40\", \"Why is the issuer important in an attestation?\", \"The issuer is crucial because trust in the issuer gives the attestation its meaning. If people don't believe the issuer is a legitimate source of truth, the attestation holds no value.\"\n",
      "\"40\", \"Who can be an issuer of an attestation?\", \"The issuer can be a person, a group of people, or even a piece of software. The choice depends on who or what is considered the source of truth for the information being attested.\"\n",
      "\"40\", \"What should be considered when choosing an issuer for an attestation?\", \"When choosing an issuer, consider who or what is the source of truth for the information.

      "\"229\", \"Can you explain the core components of a Bedrock deployment in Optimism?\", \"A Bedrock deployment in Optimism consists of two core components: the Rollup Node (op-node) and the Execution Engine (op-geth). The Rollup Node derives blocks from L1 and passes them to the Execution Engine, while also participating in a peer-to-peer network to synchronize unsubmitted blocks. The Execution Engine executes the blocks it receives and stores state, and it also provides standard JSON-RPC methods to query blockchain data and submit transactions.\"\n",
      "\"229\", \"How do the Rollup Node and Execution Engine communicate in Optimism's Bedrock deployment?\", \"In Optimism's Bedrock deployment, the Rollup Node and Execution Engine communicate with each other over JSON-RPC via the Engine API. This setup is similar to how regular Ethereum networks are deployed, with the Rollup Node functioning as the consensus client and the Execution Engine as the execution client.\"\n",
      "\"229\", \"Is there any additional component needed for OP Mainnet and OP Goerli in Optimism's Bedrock deployment?\", \"Yes, for OP Mainnet and OP Goerli (but not OP Sepolia), you may need to run a third component called Legacy Geth. Legacy Geth is used to serve execution traces for transactions prior to the Bedrock upgrade, referred to as 'historical transactions'. When the Rollup Node encounters an RPC call that requires historical execution traces, it will forward the request to Legacy Geth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"230\", \"What are the minimum system requirements to run Bedrock?\", \"To run Bedrock, you need the following minimum system requirements: For `op-node`, you need at least 2 CPUs and 4GB of RAM, with no storage necessary.

      "\n",
      "\"264\", \"Why is sending messages from L2 to L1 more difficult?\", \"Sending messages from L2 to L1 is more difficult because it requires three transactions: an initiating transaction on L2, a proving transaction on L1 that includes a merkle proof, and a claiming transaction on L1 after the fault challenge period passes. The proving transaction is particularly expensive due to the cost of merkle proof verification.\"\n",
      "\"264\", \"How long does it take to send a message from L2 to L1?\", \"Sending a message from L2 to L1 takes more than 7 days because of the fault challenge period that needs to pass before the claiming transaction can be executed on L1.\"\n",
      "\"264\", \"Is it expensive to send messages from L2 to L1?\", \"Yes, it is expensive to send messages from L2 to L1, primarily because the proving transaction on L1, which includes a merkle proof, is costly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"265\", \"How do incentives work in Optimism governance?\", \"In Optimism governance, incentives can be used to encourage honest behavior. For example, mechanisms like UMA's can be employed where honest relays get paid and dishonest ones get penalized. This is similar to how optimistic rollups function.\"\n",
      "\"265\", \"Is the incentive mechanism in Optimism governance truly decentralized?\", \"The incentive mechanism is only truly decentralized if there are enough relayers to ensure that there will always be an honest one.

      "\n",
      "\"266\", \"How can apps on OP Mainnet interact with apps on Ethereum?\", \"Apps on OP Mainnet can interact with apps on Ethereum via a process called 'bridging'. This allows contracts on OP Mainnet to trigger contract functions on Ethereum, and vice versa.\"\n",
      "\"266\", \"What is a 'call' in the context of Ethereum smart contracts?\", \"A 'call' in Ethereum smart contracts is a process where one contract triggers a function in another contract. It involves key input parameters, mainly a target address and some calldata. The target address is the address of the contract instance, and the calldata depends on the function being called.\"\n",
      "\"266\", \"What is ABI in Solidity and why is it important?\", \"ABI stands for Application Binary Interface. In Solidity, it is used to encode and decode the data that is sent to and from smart contracts. It helps in selecting which function to call and encoding the function input arguments, making it essential for contract communication.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"267\", \"How do contracts on Ethereum communicate with contracts on Optimism?\", \"Contracts on Ethereum communicate with contracts on Optimism using special smart contracts called 'messengers'. Each layer (L1 and L2) has its own messenger contract that abstracts away lower-level communication details. The main function used for this communication is `sendMessage`, which allows a contract on one network to call a contract on the other network.\"\n",
      "\"267\", \"What is the `sendMessage` function and how is it used?\", \"The `sendMessage` function is part of the messenger contracts used for communication between L1 (Ethereum) and L2 (Optimism). It takes three parameters: the target contract address, the message to be sent, and a gas limit. This function is similar to the `call` function used within L1 Ethereum, but it is used to call contracts on a different network. For example, you can use it to call a function on an Optimism contract from an Ethereum contract.\"\n",
      "\"267\", \"Where can I find the addresses of the messenger contracts on Optimism?\", \"The addresses of the messenger contracts, `L1CrossDomainMessenger` and `L2CrossDomainMessenger`, are pre-deployed on each of the Optimism networks. You can find the exact addresses of these contracts in the Optimism monorepo under the deployments section.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"268\", \"Are transactions between Ethereum and OP Mainnet instantaneous?\", \"No, transactions between Ethereum and OP Mainnet are not instantaneous. The speed of these cross-chain transactions depends on the direction in which the transaction is sent.\"\n",
      "\"268\", \"Do calls between contracts on the same blockchain take the same amount of time as calls between Ethereum and OP Mainnet?\", \"No, calls between contracts on the same blockchain are instantaneous, unlike calls between Ethereum and OP Mainnet, which are not instantaneous.\"\n",

      "\"270\", \"How long do L2 to L1 transactions take on Optimism?\", \"L2 to L1 transactions on Optimism have to wait for two periods: the time until the state root is written to L1, which can be estimated by looking at the State Commitment Chain, and the fault challenge period, which is a few seconds on Goerli and seven days on mainnet.\"\n",
      "\"270\", \"Why is there a waiting period for L2 to L1 transactions on Optimism?\", \"The waiting period is a core part of the security mechanism designed to keep funds on Optimism secure. It includes the time until the state root is written to L1 and the fault challenge period, ensuring that transactions are verified and secure before being finalized.\"\n",
      "\"270\", \"What is the fault challenge period in Optimism?\", \"The fault challenge period is a security measure that starts after the state root is written to L1 and a Merkle proof of the message is provided. It lasts a few seconds on Goerli and seven days on mainnet, allowing time to challenge any potential faults in the transaction.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"271\", \"How do contracts typically restrict access to certain functions?\", \"Contracts often use the Ownable pattern to selectively restrict access to certain functions. This pattern allows only the owner of the contract to execute specific functions.\"\n",
      "\"271\", \"What is the role of the `msg.sender` in contracts?\", \"The `msg.sender` is used in contracts to make decisions based on the calling account. It identifies the address of the account that called the contract.\"\n",
      "\"271\", \"What is the `xDomainMessageSender` function used for?\", \"The `xDomainMessageSender` function is used to determine the actual sender of a message when a contract is called by one of the messenger contracts. This is necessary because the `msg.sender` in such cases will be the messenger contract itself, not the original sender.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"272\", \"How is the cost of an L1 to L2 transaction determined?\", \"The cost of an L1 to L2 transaction is primarily determined by the gas prices on Ethereum when sending the cross-chain transaction. You send a transaction to the L1CrossDomainMessenger contract, which then sends a call to the CanonicalTransactionChain contract. The first 1.92 million gas on L2 is free, but if your transaction requires more gas, additional costs are incurred based on a 1:32 ratio of L1 gas to L2 gas.\"\n",
      "\"272\", \"What happens if my L1 to L2 transaction requires more than 1.92 million gas on L2?\", \"If your L1 to L2 transaction requires more than 1.92 million gas on L2, you can specify a higher gas limit. However, for every 32 units of L2 gas requested beyond the free 1.92 million, one unit of L1 gas is burned. This cost is incurred on L1 when the L1 contract calls L1CrossDomainMessenger, and there is no refund even if the actual L2 gas used is less than the specified limit.\"\n",
      "\"272\", \"Where can I find the current values for the free L2 gas amount and the L1 to L2 gas exchange rate?\", \"You can find the current values for the free L2 gas amount and the L1 to L2 gas exchange rate on Etherscan.

      "\n",
      "\"273\", \"How many transactions are required for a message to go from L2 to L1 in Optimism?\", \"Three transactions are required: an L2 transaction to initiate the process, an L1 transaction to prove the transaction, and another L1 transaction to finalize it.\"\n",
      "\"273\", \"Why is the L1 proof transaction considered expensive?\", \"The L1 proof transaction is expensive because it includes verifying a Merkle trie inclusion proof, which is a computationally intensive process.\"\n",
      "\"273\", \"What is the transaction challenge period for finalizing an L2 to L1 transaction on Optimism?\", \"The transaction challenge period for finalizing an L2 to L1 transaction on Optimism is 7 days on the mainnet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"274\", \"Why do messages sent from Layer 2 to Layer 1 take a week to be relayed?\", \"Messages sent from Layer 2 to Layer 1 take a week to be relayed because of the 'challenge period.' This period allows anyone to re-execute the transaction on Ethereum to prove if the published result is incorrect. This helps ensure the integrity and correctness of the transaction results.\"\n",
      "\"274\", \"What is the purpose of the challenge period in Optimistic Rollups?\", \"The challenge period in Optimistic Rollups serves to prevent incorrect transaction results from being published. During this period, anyone can re-execute the transaction on Ethereum to demonstrate that the published result is incorrect. If proven faulty, the result is discarded, and a correct result can be published instead.\"\n",
      "\"274\", \"Can the length of the challenge period be changed?\", \"Yes, the length of the challenge period can be changed. Currently, it is set to seven days on the OP Mainnet for a balance between security and usability. However, the team is open to changing this period if it can be done without significantly reducing the system's security. Users can express their opinions on this by opening an issue on GitHub.\"\n",

      "\"276\", \"Are there any restrictions on depositing ERC20 tokens using a smart contract wallet on OP Mainnet?\", \"Yes, smart contract wallets are blocked from calling the `depositERC20` function on OP Mainnet. You can use the `depositERC20To` function instead if you are familiar with the process.\"\n",
      "\"276\", \"Why are smart contract wallets blocked from calling certain deposit functions on OP Mainnet?\", \"As a safety measure, smart contract wallets are currently blocked from calling the `depositETH` and `depositERC20` functions to ensure the security and stability of the network while more smart contract wallet software is being deployed and tested.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"277\", \"How can I deposit ERC20 tokens into Optimism Layer 2?\", \"You can deposit ERC20 tokens into Optimism Layer 2 using the `depositERC20` and `depositERC20To` functions on the L1StandardBridge. However, you must first approve the Standard Token Bridge to use the amount of tokens you want to deposit, or the deposit will fail.\"\n",
      "\"277\", \"Are there any ERC20 tokens that are not supported by the Optimism bridge?\", \"Yes, the Optimism bridge does not support certain ERC20 configurations, such as fee on transfer tokens and tokens that modify balances without emitting a Transfer event. It's important to use the standard bridge contract only with tokens that have a properly configured ERC-20 version on OP Mainnet.\"\n",
      "\"277\", \"How can I check if a token can use the standard bridge on Optimism?\", \"There are two ways to check if a token can use the standard bridge: 1) Look in the token list at https://static.optimism.io/optimism.tokenlist.json. If a token can use the standard bridge, the 'chainId': 10 entry will have the standard L2 bridge address, 0x4200..0010. 2) You can 'ask' the L2 token contract by calling it. ERC-20 tokens that can use the standard bridge will have an `l2Bridge` method that returns 0x4200...0010.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"279\", \"What's the difference between USDC and USDC.e on the OP Mainnet?\", \"USDC is the native USDC issued by Circle and is considered the official form of USDC for the ecosystem. USDC.e, on the other hand, is bridged USDC from Ethereum. They are different token contracts, and it's important to use the correct one to avoid issues.\"\n",
      "\"279\", \"Why is it important to know the difference between USDC and USDC.e when using deposit functions?\", \"It's important because using the wrong token contract address when bridging can result in your assets being stuck in the bridge. You need to ensure you're bridging to the correct destination address for either USDC or USDC.e.\"\n",
      "\"279\", \"Will native USDC liquidity replace bridged USDC liquidity over time?\", \"Yes, over time, native USDC liquidity is expected to grow and replace the currently circulating bridged USDC liquidity that comes from Ethereum.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"287\", \"Why are transaction costs on OP Mainnet different from those on Ethereum?\", \"On OP Mainnet, the majority of the transaction cost comes from the L1 data fee, while the L2 execution fee is negligible. This makes the optimization tradeoffs very different compared to Ethereum.\"\n",
      "\"287\", \"How much does it cost to write one byte to L1 on OP Mainnet?\", \"Writing one byte to L1 on OP Mainnet costs approximately 720 gwei, or 720,000 units of L2 gas at the non-congested price of 0.001 gwei per L2 gas unit.\"\n",
      "\"287\", \"Is it cheaper to write data to storage or to transaction call data on OP Mainnet?\", \"It is cheaper to write data to storage. Writing a whole kilobyte to storage is less expensive than adding one byte to the transaction call data.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"288\", \"Why is the standard ABI not optimal for OP Mainnet?\", \"The standard ABI uses four-byte function selectors and pads values to a 32-byte size, which is not efficient for OP Mainnet.

      "\n",
      "\"289\", \"Why should I avoid using `uint256` for storing ETH balances?\", \"Using `uint256` for storing ETH balances is overkill because it can represent numbers up to about 1.2*10<sup>77</sup>, while the total supply of ETH is only around 120 million. Instead, you can use `uint88`, which is more efficient as it uses fewer bytes.\"\n",
      "\"289\", \"How can I optimize the storage of values in my smart contracts?\", \"You can optimize storage by identifying values that will never reach 32 bytes and reducing them to more logical sizes. For example, instead of using `uint256` for all amounts, you can use smaller data types like `uint88` for ETH balances. This process can also be applied to other data types like ints and bytes.\"\n",
      "\"289\", \"What is the benefit of using smaller data types in my smart contracts?\", \"Using smaller data types reduces the amount of storage space required, which can lead to more efficient and cost-effective smart contracts.

This is different from the normal behavior where `tx.origin` would be the original sender of the transaction.\"\n",
      "\"297\", \"What is the behavior of the `CALLER` opcode in an L1 to L2 transaction on Optimism?\", \"In an L1 to L2 transaction on Optimism, if it is the initial call, the `CALLER` opcode will also follow the address aliasing behavior. This means `msg.sender` will be the aliased address of the original sender from L1.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"298\", \"How can I get information about the latest L1 block in Optimism?\", \"You can get information about the latest L1 block from the `L1Block` contract. This contract is predeployed at the address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015` on the Optimism network.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"299\", \"How does the `CREATE` opcode behavior affect contract addresses on L1 and L2?\", \"The `CREATE` opcode can result in a user creating a contract on L1 and L2 that share the same address but have different bytecode. This can break trust assumptions because one contract may be trusted while the other is untrusted.\"\n",
      "\"299\", \"What is the difference in the value of `tx.origin` between L1 and L2?\", \"The value of `tx.origin` is determined by the source of the call. For L2 and L1 users (Externally Owned Accounts), it is the user's address, same as in Ethereum. For L1 contracts using `CanonicalTransactionChain.enqueue`, it is the L1 contract address plus `0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111`.\"\n",
      "\"299\", \"Why should `tx.origin` generally not be used for authorization?\", \"In general, `tx.origin` should not be used for authorization because it can lead to security vulnerabilities. This is a separate issue from address aliasing, which also affects `msg.sender`.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"300\", \"Why is it a problem to have two identical source addresses for L1 and L2 contracts?\", \"The problem with having two identical source addresses for L1 and L2 contracts is that trust is extended based on the address. This means you might want to trust one contract but not the other, which can lead to security issues.\"\n",
      "\"300\", \"How does OP Mainnet protect users like Nimrod from potential scams?\", \"OP Mainnet protects users by modifying the transaction's `tx.origin` (which is also the initial `msg.sender`). This ensures that a transaction coming from an L1 contract with the same address as an L2 contract will be recognized as coming from a different address, one that does not have the allowance.\"\n",
      "\"300\", \"What is the significance of the allowance in the context of the Hackswap example?\", \"In the Hackswap example, Nimrod approves an allowance of 1000 DAI for the Hackswap contract, expecting to swap it for nearly 1100 USDT. The allowance is significant because it permits the contract to transfer a specified amount of tokens on behalf of the user. However, due to OP Mainnet's protection, a transaction from an L1 contract with the same address cannot misuse this allowance.\"\n",

      "\"334\", \"How low can I set the Max Priority Fee on OP Chains?\", \"You can set the Max Priority Fee to as low as 0.0001 gwei on OP Chains.\"\n",
      "\"334\", \"Why is it important to keep the priority fee low in a transaction?\", \"The priority fee is the amount that the user pays, so it makes sense to keep it as low as possible to minimize transaction costs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"335\", \"Why do users on OP Mainnet have to pay an L1 data fee?\", \"Users on OP Mainnet have to pay an L1 data fee because all transactions on OP Mainnet are also published to Ethereum. This ensures that all the data needed to sync an OP Mainnet node is publicly available on Ethereum, which is crucial for the security of OP Mainnet.\"\n",
      "\"335\", \"What factors determine the L1 data fee on OP Mainnet?\", \"The L1 data fee on OP Mainnet is determined by four factors: the current gas price on Ethereum, the gas cost to publish the transaction to Ethereum (which scales with the size of the transaction in bytes), a fixed overhead cost denominated in gas (currently set to 188), and a dynamic overhead cost that scales the L1 fee by a fixed number (currently set to 0.684).\"\n",
      "\"335\", \"Can users set limits for the L1 data fee on OP Mainnet?\", \"No, users are not able to set limits for the L1 data fee on OP Mainnet. The L1 gas price used to charge the data fee is automatically updated when new data is received from Ethereum. Spikes in Ethereum gas prices may result in users paying a higher or lower than estimated L1 data fee, by up to 25%.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"336\", \"How do I send a transaction on OP Mainnet?\", \"The process of sending a transaction on OP Mainnet is identical to the process of sending a transaction on Ethereum. You need to provide a gas price greater than or equal to the current L2 gas price or use transaction type 2 with a priority fee within the same range as the transactions included in the latest block. Additionally, you should set your transaction gas limit in the same way you would on Ethereum, for example, using `eth_estimateGas`.\"\n",
      "\"336\", \"What gas price should I use when sending a transaction on OP Mainnet?\", \"You should provide a gas price that is greater than or equal to the current L2 gas price.

      "\n",
      "\"337\", \"How are transaction fees calculated on OP Mainnet?\", \"On OP Mainnet, transaction fees are calculated by summing both an L2 execution fee and an L1 data fee. This provides users with the most accurate estimate of the total cost of a transaction.\"\n",
      "\"337\", \"Why can't I just use the gas price and gas limit to estimate fees on OP Mainnet?\", \"On OP Mainnet, using just the gas price and gas limit won't give you an accurate estimate because you need to account for both the L2 execution fee and the L1 data fee. Both of these fees combined give the true cost of a transaction.\"\n",
      "\"337\", \"Is there a resource to help me estimate gas fees for OP Mainnet transactions?\", \"Yes, there is a code sample using the JavaScript SDK available [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/sdk-estimate-gas) that can help you estimate gas fees for OP Mainnet transactions.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"341\", \"How do I send the maximum amount of ETH from my wallet on Optimism?\", \"To send the maximum amount of ETH from your wallet on Optimism, you need to subtract the estimated L2 execution fee and the estimated L1 data fee from the total amount of ETH you have. This ensures that you have enough ETH to cover the transaction fees.\"\n",
      "\"341\", \"What are the fees involved when sending ETH on Optimism?\", \"When sending ETH on Optimism, you need to account for two types of fees: the L2 execution fee and the L1 data fee. These fees need to be subtracted from the total amount of ETH you want to send to ensure the transaction can be processed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"342\", \"Why am I getting an error code `-32000` when trying to send a transaction on Optimism?\", \"You are getting this error because you don't have enough ETH to cover the value of the transaction, the L2 execution fee, and the L1 data fee.\"\n",
      "\"342\", \"What does the error message `invalid transaction: insufficient funds for l1Fee + l2Fee + value` mean?\", \"This error message means that you don't have enough ETH to pay for the transaction value, the L2 execution fee, and the L1 data fee. You need to ensure you have sufficient funds to cover all these costs.\"\n",
      "\"342\", \"How can I avoid the `invalid transaction: insufficient funds for l1Fee + l2Fee + value` error when sending max ETH?\", \"To avoid this error, make sure to account for both the L2 execution fee and the L1 data fee in addition to the transaction value when sending max ETH. This ensures you have enough funds to cover all necessary fees.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"344\", \"Why might my transaction on the OP Chain become stuck?\", \"Your transaction might become stuck if the maximum fee per gas specified by your transaction is less than the block base fee.

      "\"344\", \"Is there a way to fix a stuck transaction on the OP Chain?\", \"Yes, there is a workaround that users and wallet operators can implement immediately to fix a stuck transaction. Additionally, a protocol-level fix is expected to be live by the end of Q4.\"\n",
      "\"344\", \"How does the base fee growth on OP Chain compare to L1 Ethereum?\", \"On the OP Chain, the base fee can grow by up to 77% in a twelve-second period, whereas on L1 Ethereum, it can grow by up to 12.5% in the same period.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"345\", \"How can I save on the cost of L2 gas on Optimism?\", \"To save on the cost of L2 gas, you should minimize the max priority fee for your transactions.\"\n",
      "\"345\", \"Does setting a high maximum fee per gas increase my transaction cost on Optimism?\", \"No, setting a high maximum fee per gas, such as 0.1 gwei, will not increase your transaction cost because the same base fee, determined by a formula, is charged to all transactions in the block.\"\n",
      "\"345\", \"Why might I need to suggest a higher multiple of the base fee on Optimism compared to L1 Ethereum?\", \"You might need to suggest a higher multiple of the base fee on Optimism if the current base fee is comparable to 0.1 gwei or higher, because the base fee can grow faster in the time interval between transaction creation and transaction signing and submission.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"346\", \"Who determines the default priority fee and max fee for a transaction in Optimism?\", \"Wallets are usually in charge of determining the default priority fee and max fee that a transaction would include, so the recommendations can be applied directly.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"349\", \"Why don't deposit transactions on Optimism's L2 have a chainID?\", \"Deposit transactions on Optimism's L2 don't have a chainID because they come from a dummy address and don't have a signature. In Ethereum, the chainID is encoded as part of the signature, so without a signature, there's no recoverable chainID. However, this isn't a problem because these transactions are only created during the block derivation process, and there's no need to recover the chainID.\"\n",
      "\"349\", \"What are deposit transactions in Optimism?\", \"Deposit transactions in Optimism are transactions added to the L2 blockchain as part of the block derivation process.

      "\"522\", \"What do I need to do to add my custom bridge and token to the Superchain token list?\", \"To add your custom bridge and token to the Superchain token list, your bridge contracts must implement the `IL1ERC20Bridge` interface in the L1 bridge contract and `IL2ERC20Bridge` interface in the L2 bridge contract. You must then make a pull request against the Superchain token list repository. Additionally, you need to deploy your custom bridge to OP Goerli first before going to production due to the complexity of reviewing a custom bridge.\"\n",

      "\"591\", \"What role does user feedback play in the development of Optimism?\", \"User feedback plays a crucial role in the development of Optimism. The iterative approach to protocol development means that many core features, such as EVM Equivalence, were made possible by continuously pulling feedback from users and making adjustments based on that input.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"592\", \"Why is long-term sustainability important for Optimism?\", \"Long-term sustainability is important for Optimism because application developers need assurance that the platform they are building on will remain operational and competitive over long periods of time. This ensures that the ecosystem can continue to grow and thrive.\"\n",
      "\"592\", \"How does Optimism ensure that its protocol remains sustainable?\", \"Optimism ensures its protocol remains sustainable by focusing on simplicity in its design process.

      "\n",
      "\"593\", \"How is Optimism related to Ethereum?\", \"Optimism is designed as an extension to Ethereum. Although it looks like a standalone blockchain, it is closely integrated with Ethereum to help it succeed and to redesign our relationships with institutions.\"\n",
      "\"593\", \"Why is the project named 'Optimism'?\", \"The project is named 'Optimism' because the team believes in an optimistic future for Ethereum. Their optimism about Ethereum's vision is what keeps the project moving forward.\"\n",
      "\"593\", \"What is the main goal of Optimism?\", \"The main goal of Optimism is to support the success of Ethereum by creating features and simplifying existing ones, all while staying as close to Ethereum as possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"594\", \"How does Optimism work?\", \"Optimism works using a technology called Optimistic Rollup.

This process helps to increase transaction throughput and reduce fees.\"\n",
      "\"594\", \"Why is Optimism built as an Optimistic Rollup?\", \"Optimism is built as an Optimistic Rollup because it effectively addresses the design goals of the system. It allows for higher transaction throughput and lower fees while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum blockchain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"595\", \"How does Optimism ensure its security?\", \"Optimism ensures its security by piggy-backing off the security of a parent blockchain, specifically Ethereum. It uses Ethereum's consensus mechanism, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), instead of providing its own.\"\n",
      "\"595\", \"What is an Optimistic Rollup?\", \"An Optimistic Rollup is a type of blockchain that relies on the security of another 'parent' blockchain. It leverages the consensus mechanism of the parent chain to ensure its own security.\"\n",
      "\"595\", \"What parent blockchain does OP Mainnet use?\", \"OP Mainnet uses Ethereum as its parent blockchain to ensure its security.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"596\", \"How are Bedrock L2 blocks saved to the Ethereum blockchain?\", \"Bedrock L2 blocks are saved to the Ethereum blockchain using a non-contract address to minimize the L1 gas expense. These blocks are submitted as transaction calldata on Ethereum, making them immutable and uncensorable once included in a block with enough attestations.\"\n",
      "\"596\", \"Why is it important to write blocks to L1 in a compressed format?\", \"Writing blocks to L1 in a compressed format is important because it helps reduce costs. Writing to L1 is the major cost of OP Mainnet transactions, so compression helps make the process more economical.\"\n",
      "\"596\", \"What guarantees does OP Mainnet inherit from Ethereum?\", \"OP Mainnet inherits the availability and integrity guarantees of Ethereum because the blocks are submitted as transaction calldata on Ethereum, making them immutable and uncensorable once included in a block with enough attestations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"597\", \"Who manages block production in Optimism?\", \"Block production in Optimism is primarily managed by a single party called the 'sequencer.' The sequencer provides transaction confirmations, state updates, constructs and executes L2 blocks, and submits user transactions to L1.\"\n",
      "\"597\", \"How often are blocks produced on the OP Mainnet?\", \"On the OP Mainnet, blocks are produced every two seconds, regardless of whether they are empty or filled with transactions.\"\n",
      "\"597\", \"What are the two ways transactions can get to the sequencer in Optimism?\", \"Transactions can get to the sequencer in two ways: 1) Transactions submitted on L1, called 'deposits,' which are included in the appropriate L2 block. 2) Transactions submitted directly to the sequencer, which are cheaper but cannot be made censorship resistant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"598\", \"How does the execution engine in Optimism receive blocks?\", \"The execution engine in Optimism, implemented as the `op-geth` component, receives blocks using two mechanisms: it can update itself using a peer-to-peer network with other execution engines, similar to how L1 execution clients synchronize state across the network, and it can derive L2 blocks from L1 using the rollup node, implemented as the `op-node` component.\"\n",
      "\"598\", \"What is the difference between the two mechanisms for receiving blocks in Optimism?\", \"The first mechanism involves the execution engine updating itself through a peer-to-peer network with other execution engines, which is similar to how L1 execution clients synchronize state. The second mechanism involves the rollup node deriving L2 blocks from L1, which is slower but offers censorship resistance.\"\n",
      "\"598\", \"Where can I find more detailed information about the synchronization mechanisms of the execution engine in Optimism?\", \"You can find more detailed information about the synchronization mechanisms of the execution engine in the Optimism specs. For the peer-to-peer network synchronization, refer to the 'happy-path-sync' section, and for the rollup node mechanism, refer to the 'worst-case-sync' section.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"599\", \"Can I transfer ERC20 tokens between Ethereum and Optimism?\", \"Yes, you can transfer ERC20 tokens between Ethereum and Optimism. Optimism allows users to send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on L2 (like OP Mainnet) and the underlying L1 (Ethereum mainnet). This functionality is used in the Standard bridge to deposit and withdraw assets, including ERC20 tokens, between the two networks.\"\n",
      "\"599\", \"How does Optimism handle asset transfers between Ethereum and its own network?\", \"Optimism uses a mechanism that allows communication between smart contracts on L2 (Optimism) and L1 (Ethereum). The exact mechanism varies depending on the direction of the message. For example, the Standard bridge on OP Mainnet enables users to deposit assets from Ethereum to OP Mainnet and withdraw them back to Ethereum.\"\n",
      "\"599\", \"Where can I find more technical details about the Standard bridge in Optimism?\", \"You can find more technical details and examples about the Standard bridge in the developer documentation. The documentation provides insights into the inner workings of the Standard bridge and how it facilitates asset transfers between Ethereum and Optimism.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"600\", \"How are transactions from Ethereum to OP Mainnet referred to in Optimism terminology?\", \"In Optimism terminology, transactions going from Ethereum (L1) to OP Mainnet (L2) are called deposits, even if they do not have any assets attached to them.\"\n",
      "\"600\", \"What tools can be used to perform deposit transactions in Optimism?\", \"You can use L1CrossDomainMessenger or L1StandardBridge to perform deposit transactions in Optimism.\"\n",
      "\"600\", \"When do deposit transactions become part of the canonical blockchain in Optimism?\", \"Deposit transactions become part of the canonical blockchain in the first L2 block of the 'epoch' corresponding to the L1 block where the deposits were made. This L2 block is usually created a few minutes after the corresponding L1 block.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"601\", \"How do withdrawals work on Optimism?\", \"Withdrawals on Optimism have three stages: First, you initialize the withdrawal with an L2 transaction. Then, you wait for the next output root to be submitted to L1 and submit the withdrawal proof using `proveWithdrawalTransaction`. Finally, after the fault challenge period ends (a week on mainnet, less on the test network), you can finalize the withdrawal.\"\n",
      "\"601\", \"What is the purpose of the fault challenge period in the withdrawal process?\", \"The fault challenge period, which lasts a week on mainnet, allows time to identify and challenge any incorrect withdrawals or output roots. This helps protect OP Mainnet users from potential bridge vulnerabilities.\"\n",
      "\"601\", \"Can withdrawals on Optimism be monitored offchain?\", \"Yes, the new step of submitting the withdrawal proof using `proveWithdrawalTransaction` enables offchain monitoring of withdrawals. This makes it easier to identify incorrect withdrawals or output roots.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"602\", \"How does Optimism ensure the validity of state commitments on Ethereum?\", \"In an Optimistic Rollup, state commitments are published to Ethereum without direct proof of their validity. These commitments are considered pending during a 'challenge window' of 7 days. If a commitment goes unchallenged during this period, it is considered final and smart contracts on Ethereum can safely accept withdrawal proofs based on that commitment.\"\n",
      "\"602\", \"What happens if a state commitment on Optimism is challenged?\", \"If a state commitment is challenged, it can be invalidated through a 'fault proof' process. If the challenge is successful, the commitment is removed from the StateCommitmentChain and will eventually be replaced by another proposed commitment. Importantly, a successful challenge does not roll back OP Mainnet itself; it only affects the published commitments about the state of the chain.\"\n",
      "\"602\", \"What is the 'challenge window' in Optimism's rollup process?\", \"The 'challenge window' is a period of time, currently set to 7 days, during which state commitments published to Ethereum can be challenged. If a commitment goes unchallenged for the duration of this window, it is considered final.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"604\", \"Does Optimism have a roadmap for future releases?\", \"Yes, Optimism has a planned roadmap for future releases, which you can find summarized on their website.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"605\", \"Is the fault proof mechanism currently active on the OP Mainnet network?\", \"No, the fault proof mechanism had to be temporarily disabled as part of the OVM 2.0 upgrade. Users currently need to trust the Sequencer node run by the Optimism Foundation to publish valid state roots to Ethereum.\"\n",
      "\"605\", \"When is the fault proof mechanism expected to be back in production?\", \"The Optimism team is making progress on the upgrade fault proof mechanism and expects to productionize their work in 2023.\"\n",
      "\"605\", \"Where can I find more information about the security model of Optimism?\", \"You can read more about the security model of Optimism in their documentation, specifically at the security model section [here](../security-model/README.md).\"\n",

      "\"606\", \"What is the plan for decentralizing the sequencer on Optimism?\", \"The plan involves initially rotating the sequencer with some frequency using an economic mechanism to create a competitive market for sequencing and a governance mechanism to ensure long-term network health. Eventually, the goal is to support multiple concurrent sequencers using a standard BFT consensus protocol.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"607\", \"How does the deposit process work in Optimism?\", \"The deposit process in Optimism involves transferring assets from the Ethereum mainnet to the Optimism Layer 2 network. This typically requires using a bridge to lock assets on the mainnet and mint corresponding tokens on Optimism.\"\n",
      "\"607\", \"What is the purpose of the deposit flow in Optimism?\", \"The deposit flow in Optimism is designed to enable users to move their assets from the Ethereum mainnet to the Optimism Layer 2 network, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions while still benefiting from Ethereum's security.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"608\", \"What's a deposit transaction in Optimism?\", \"In Optimism terminology, a deposit transaction refers to any Layer 2 (L2) transaction that is triggered by a transaction or event on Layer 1 (L1). It may or may not have assets like ETH or tokens attached to it.\"\n",
      "\"608\", \"Does a deposit transaction always include assets like ETH or tokens?\", \"No, a deposit transaction in Optimism may or may not have assets such as ETH or tokens attached to it.\"\n",
      "\"608\", \"How is the process of a deposit transaction in Optimism similar to networking?\", \"The process of a deposit transaction in Optimism is somewhat similar to the way most networking stacks work. Information is encapsulated in lower layer packets on the sending side and then retrieved and used by those layers on the receiving side while going up the stack to the receiving application.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"609\", \"How does an L1 entity send a message to an L2 address in Optimism?\", \"An L1 entity, either a smart contract or an externally owned account (EOA), sends a deposit transaction to the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` using the `sendMessage` function. This function requires three parameters: the target address on L2, the L2 transaction's calldata, and the minimum gas limit for the transaction on L2.\"\n",
      "\"609\", \"What happens after the L1CrossDomainMessenger receives a deposit transaction?\", \"The L1CrossDomainMessenger calls its own `_send` function, which uses parameters such as the destination address (always `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000007` for deposits), the gas limit, the ETH sent with the message, and the calldata for the call on L2. This calldata is an ABI-encoded call to `relayMessage`.\"\n",
      "\"609\", \"Can other contracts call the `depositTransaction` function directly?\", \"Yes, other contracts can call the `depositTransaction` function directly. However, doing so bypasses certain safeguards, so it is generally not recommended. The `depositTransaction` function performs sanity checks and emits a `TransactionDeposited` event.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"610\", \"How does the `op-node` component handle `TransactionDeposited` events on L1?\", \"The `op-node` component looks for `TransactionDeposited` events on L1. If it sees any such events, it parses them and then converts those events into deposit transactions.\"\n",
      "\"610\", \"What happens after the `op-node` converts `TransactionDeposited` events into deposit transactions?\", \"In most cases, user deposit transactions call the `relayMessage` function of the `L2CrossDomainMessenger`. This function runs a few sanity checks and then, if everything is good, calls the real target contract with the relayed calldata.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"611\", \"Who bears the cost of a deposit transaction in Optimism?\", \"The L1 costs of a deposit are borne by the transaction's originator.\"\n",
      "\"611\", \"How does Optimism prevent denial of service (DoS) attacks related to high-cost transactions on L2?\", \"To avoid DoS attacks, the `depositTransaction` function and the functions that call it require a gas limit parameter. This gas limit is encoded into the `TransactionDeposited` event and used as the gas limit for the user deposit transaction on L2.\"\n",
      "\"611\", \"Who processes the L2 part of a transaction in Optimism?\", \"The L2 processing of the transaction is performed by the Optimism nodes.\"\n",

Unsafe transactions are processed but not yet written to L1 and can be dropped due to a batcher fault. Safe transactions are processed and written to L1 but might be dropped due to a reorganization at the L1 level. Finalized transactions are written to L1 in an old enough block that is extremely unlikely to be reorganized.\"\n",
      "\"631\", \"When is a transaction considered irrevocable in Optimism?\", \"A transaction is considered irrevocable in Optimism once it is finalized.

It accepts three parameters: `_target` (the target address on L1), `_message` (the L1 transaction's calldata), and `_minGasLimit` (the minimum amount of gas that the withdrawal finalizing transaction can provide). This function is used to initiate cross-domain messages and calls the `_sendMessage` function, which is specific to L2CrossDomainMessenger.\"\n",
      "\"637\", \"What happens when the `sendMessage` function is called on L2?\", \"When the `sendMessage` function is called on L2, it calls the `_sendMessage` function, which then calls the `initiateWithdrawal` function on the L2ToL1MessagePasser contract. This function calculates the hash of the raw withdrawal fields, marks that hash as a sent message in `sentMessages`, and emits a `MessagePassed` event with the fields and the hash.\"\n",
      "\"637\", \"What are the raw withdrawal fields used in the `initiateWithdrawal` function?\", \"The raw withdrawal fields used in the `initiateWithdrawal` function are: `nonce` (a single-use value to prevent identical withdrawals from hashing to the same value), `sender` (the L2 address that initiated the transfer), `target` (the L1 target address), `value` (the amount of WEI transferred), `gasLimit` (the gas limit for the transaction), and `data` (the calldata for the withdrawal transaction).\"\n",
