"33", "What should be considered when aggregating data?", "When aggregating data, it is important to avoid using arbitrary inputs and to ensure there is a way to measure the effectiveness of the data aggregation. This helps maintain the integrity and usefulness of the data collected."
"34", "How does the identity stack framework help in understanding identity and reputation in Optimism?", "The identity stack framework helps to see how different elements of identity and reputation fit together by organizing them into layers: data, data interpretation, identity, and UI. Each layer has specific roles and functions, from raw data production to user interfaces that integrate and display this information."
"34", "What is the role of the data interpretation layer in the identity stack framework?", "The data interpretation layer includes algorithms, aggregations, and analytics that process the raw data from the data layer. Data aggregators in this layer analyze the data to provide valuable insights and metrics, which can be used for various purposes like Retro Funding evaluation and smart defaults in the Token House."
"34", "Why is the identity layer considered the narrowest point in the identity stack framework?", "The identity layer is considered the narrowest point because it represents how individual users and projects are identified within the Optimism Collective. Having multiple competing identity offerings could be detrimental, as it might split a person's identity across multiple accounts, leading to fragmentation and inconsistency."
"35", "How should we approach building solutions for identity in the Optimism Collective?", "We should focus on building vertical slices of the identity stack, solving specific user problems end-to-end rather than building out all possible use cases horizontally. This ensures that each piece serves a purpose and gets adoption."
"35", "What should developers consider when building within the identity and reputation space in the Optimism Collective?", "Developers should solve specific and real problems for a clearly-defined user group, consider how their solutions relate to the various layers of the identity stack, and adopt a shared user and project identity structure."
"35", "Where can I find ideas and requests for valuable work in the Optimism Collective?", "You can refer to the Builder Ideas List, Delegate Mission Requests, and Foundation Mission Requests for specific input and ideas on valuable work. If your work fits within the framework but is not represented in these channels, you can email identity@optimism.io to see if a Mission Grant could support it."

"36", "Who is currently the issuer of attestations about Badgeholders in the Optimism Collective?", "The Optimism Foundation is currently the issuer of attestations about who is a Badgeholder in the Optimism Collective."
"37", "How can attestations be useful when dealing with off-chain data?", "Attestations can be useful for providing public, consumable, and trusted data that is not available on-chain. They are especially valuable when you need an entity to sign a claim, ensuring the data's authenticity and source."
"37", "What should I consider if I want to make my attestation private?", "You should consider whether making the attestation private is appropriate for your use case. The content of attestations can be made private, and you can find more information on how to do this in the documentation."
"37", "How can I ensure that the data I generate is verifiable by others?", "By making the data an attestation, you can ensure it is consumable and verifiable by others. This process allows you to confirm that you are the source of the data, adding a layer of trust and authenticity."
"38", "Why would I not need to turn certain data into an attestation?", "If the data doesn't need to be shared or consumed by anyone, there's probably no reason to turn it into an attestation."
"38", "What kind of data doesn't need to be an attestation?", "Data that can be derived on-chain, such as an account's balance or transaction histories, doesn't need to be an attestation."
"39", "Why is it important to issue relevant attestations in the Collective?", "Issuing relevant attestations is important because it helps build a meaningful identity within the Collective. Irrelevant attestations create noise, making it harder to filter out useful information."
"39", "When is a good moment to issue an attestation?", "A good moment to issue an attestation is when there is already a use-case for it. This means the attestation will be immediately consumed for a specific purpose and solve a real need or problem, such as attestation-gated channels in Discord."
"39", "What should you consider if you're unsure about issuing an attestation?", "If you're unsure about issuing an attestation, consider the importance of the information in the context of the value chain it is part of. For example, in Retro Funding, the fact that a project received funding is more valuable than the fact that it simply applied."
"40", "Why is the issuer important in an attestation?", "The issuer is crucial because trust in the issuer gives the attestation its meaning. If people don't believe the issuer is a legitimate source of truth, the attestation holds no value."
"40", "Who can be an issuer of an attestation?", "The issuer can be a person, a group of people, or even a piece of software. The choice depends on who or what is considered the source of truth for the information being attested."
"40", "What happens if it's impractical for software to be the issuer?", "If it's impractical for software to be the issuer, it's reasonable to find an individual or organization that is a legitimate authority and trusted by others to issue the attestations."
"41", "Why is it important to use schemas for attestations?", "Schemas ensure that similar attestations are structured in the same way and can be identified as belonging to a set, which is vital for attestation consumers."
"41", "What should I do before creating a new schema?", "Before creating a new schema, you should check to see if a relevant schema already exists."
"41", "What are some tips for designing a schema?", "Some tips for designing a schema include keeping it simple, being descriptive, avoiding redundancy, planning for the future, and considering gas efficiency to reduce costs."
"42", "What's the difference between onchain and offchain attestations?", "Onchain attestations are easier for smart contracts to read and are directly verifiable on the blockchain, but they are associated with gas fees and transaction times, making them less scalable. Offchain attestations, on the other hand, offer more privacy options and can be deleted, but they require separate revocation management."
"42", "Can onchain attestations be deleted?", "No, onchain attestations are immutable and cannot be deleted. However, offchain attestations can be deleted."
"42", "Are there any costs associated with onchain attestations?", "Yes, onchain attestations are associated with gas fees and transaction times, which can make them less scalable compared to offchain attestations."
"43", "How can I get support for running an Optimism event in my local community?", "We are developing a program to better support you in bringing your local community into the Optimism Collective. You can sign up to be a part of the program, and we will message you when it goes live."

"75", "How long did it take for deposits to confirm before the Bedrock update?", "Before the Bedrock update, it could take up to 10 minutes to confirm deposits."
"76", "How does Bedrock handle proof systems in the OP Stack?", "Bedrock abstracts the proof system from the OP Stack, allowing a rollup to use either a fault proof or a validity proof (such as a zk-SNARK) to prove the correct execution of inputs on the rollup."
"76", "What is the benefit of Bedrock abstracting the proof system?", "The abstraction allows for flexibility in the proof system used, enabling systems like Cannon to be utilized for proving faults in the system."
"76", "What is Cannon in the context of Bedrock and the OP Stack?", "Cannon is a system that can be used to prove faults in the rollup, thanks to Bedrock's abstraction of the proof system."
"77", "How has the performance of the node software been improved in the latest version?", "The performance of the node software has been significantly improved by enabling the execution of several transactions in a single rollup 'block' instead of the previous 'one transaction per block' model. This change allows the cost of merkle trie updates to be spread across multiple transactions, reducing state growth by approximately 15GB/year at current transaction volumes."
"77", "What changes have been made to reduce technical debt in the new version of the protocol?", "To reduce technical debt, the new version of the protocol has removed the need for a separate 'data transport layer' node to index L1. Additionally, the node software has been updated to efficiently query for transaction data from L1."
"77", "How does the new model of executing several transactions in a single rollup block benefit the system?", "The new model of executing several transactions in a single rollup block benefits the system by amortizing the cost of merkle trie updates across multiple transactions. This reduces state growth by approximately 15GB/year at current transaction volumes, leading to better overall performance."
"78", "How does Bedrock compare to Ethereum?", "Bedrock was designed to be as close to Ethereum as possible.

"80", "What are some examples of the modular design in Bedrock?", "Some examples of the modular design in Bedrock include the separation of the rollup node and execution client, and the modular fault proof design."
"81", "How does Bedrock ensure security for its users?", "Bedrock ensures security by using existing Ethereum architecture and infrastructure as much as possible. This allows it to inherit the security benefits from the well-tested codebases used in production on Ethereum Mainnet."
"81", "What are some examples of how Bedrock uses Ethereum's existing infrastructure?", "Some examples include minimally modified execution clients and using EVM contracts instead of precompiled client code."
"82", "How does Bedrock ensure compatibility with the existing Ethereum developer experience?", "Bedrock is designed to have maximum compatibility with the existing Ethereum developer experience, with a few exceptions due to fundamental differences between a Layer 1 (L1) and a rollup. These exceptions include an altered fee model, faster block time (2 seconds vs 12 seconds), and a special transaction type for including L1 deposit transactions."
"82", "What are some of the fundamental differences between Bedrock and Ethereum?", "Some fundamental differences between Bedrock and Ethereum include an altered fee model, faster block time (2 seconds vs 12 seconds), and a special transaction type for including L1 deposit transactions."
"82", "How does Bedrock handle fault proofs and code re-use?", "Bedrock has a fault proof designed to prove faults of a minimally modified Ethereum execution client. It also re-uses the code of the Ethereum execution client for use by nodes in the L2 network and sequencers."
"83", "How do rollups derive their data availability source?", "Rollups derive their data availability source generally from an L1 blockchain like Ethereum."
"83", "What are the primary sources of information for a canonical L2 chain in rollup protocols?", "The primary sources of information for a canonical L2 chain in rollup protocols are transaction data posted by Sequencers to the L1 and deposit transactions posted by accounts and contracts to a bridge contract on L1."
"83", "What is the role of proof systems in rollup protocols?", "Proof systems define the finality of posted output roots on the L1, allowing them to be executed upon, such as for executing withdrawals."
"84", "What's a deposit in the context of Optimism?", "A deposit is a transaction on Layer 1 (L1) that is meant to be included in the rollup. It is guaranteed to be included in the canonical Layer 2 (L2) chain to prevent censorship or control of the L2."
"84", "How does Optimism ensure that deposits are not censored?", "Optimism guarantees that deposits will be included in the canonical Layer 2 (L2) chain, which prevents any form of censorship or control over these transactions."
"85", "How does a deposited transaction work in Optimism?", "A deposited transaction in Optimism is a transaction on the rollup that is made as part of a deposit. With the Bedrock upgrade, deposits are fully generalized Ethereum transactions, meaning an account or contract on Ethereum can deposit a contract creation. These transactions on the L2 are derived from the values in the events emitted by the deposit contract on the L1."
"85", "What is a deposit contract in the context of Optimism?", "A deposit contract in Optimism is a smart contract available on the L1 (Layer 1) that L1 accounts and contracts can interact with to write to the L2 (Layer 2). It emits events that include parameters such as from, to, and data, which are used to derive deposited transactions on the L2."
"85", "Where can I find more details about the deposit contract in Optimism?", "For full details about the deposit contract in Optimism, you can refer to the deposit contract section of the protocol specifications available on GitHub at this link: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/65ec61dde94ffa93342728d324fecf474d228e1f/specs/deposits.md#deposit-contract."
"86", "How does the gas burn mechanism work in Optimism's Bedrock?", "In Optimism's Bedrock, the gas burn mechanism involves buying gas on Layer 1 (L1) via a gas burn to be used on Layer 2 (L2). This gas is purchased on a fee market, and there is a hard cap on the amount of gas provided to all deposits in a single L1 block. This mechanism helps prevent denial of service attacks by ensuring that gas-intensive transactions on L2 are not cheap to execute from L1."
"86", "What is 'guaranteed gas' in the context of Optimism's Bedrock?", "Guaranteed gas refers to the gas provided to deposited transactions on L2, which is paid for by burning gas on L1. This gas is unique because it is not refundable. The amount of L1 gas that must be burned per unit of guaranteed L2 gas depends on the price of L2 gas, which is determined by an EIP-1559 style fee mechanism."
"86", "Why is there a hard cap on the amount of gas provided to deposits in a single L1 block in Optimism's Bedrock?", "The hard cap on the amount of gas provided to deposits in a single L1 block is implemented to prevent denial of service attacks. This ensures that transactions written to L2 from L1, which could be extremely gas-intensive on L2 but cheap on L1, do not overwhelm the system."
"87", "How are withdrawals initiated and finalized in the Optimism network?", "Withdrawals are initiated on Layer 2 (L2) via a call to the Message Passer predeploy contract, which records the important properties of the message in its storage. They are finalized on Layer 1 (L1) via a call to the OptimismPortal contract, which proves the inclusion of the withdrawal message."
"87", "What can withdrawals be used for in the Optimism network?", "Withdrawals can be used by an L2 account to call an L1 contract or to transfer ETH from an L2 account to an L1 account."
"87", "How are withdrawals different from deposits in the Optimism network?", "Withdrawals are different from deposits because they do not rely on block derivation. Instead, withdrawal transactions must use smart contracts on L1 for finalization."
"88", "How does the Bedrock release improve the security of withdrawals in Optimism?", "The Bedrock release introduces a two-step withdrawal process that includes submitting a Merkle proof 7 days before the withdrawal can be finalized. This extra step allows monitoring tools to detect invalid withdrawal proofs within those 7 days, reducing the risk of bridge hacks and allowing time to deploy a contract fix if needed."
"88", "What is the purpose of the 7-day period in the new withdrawal process?", "The 7-day period in the new withdrawal process is designed to give monitoring tools enough time to detect any invalid withdrawal proofs. If an invalid proof is found, a contract fix can be deployed before any funds are lost, thereby enhancing the security of the withdrawal process."
"88", "Why are withdrawal proof validation bugs significant in the context of bridge hacks?", "Withdrawal proof validation bugs have been the root cause of many major bridge hacks in recent years. These bugs can allow malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities and steal funds. The new withdrawal process in the Bedrock release aims to mitigate this risk by adding an extra layer of defense against such bugs."
"89", "How does Bedrock handle messaging between L1 and L2?", "In Bedrock, a wire format is defined for messaging between L1 and L2. This format is used for L2 to derive blocks from L1 and for L2 to write transactions to L1. It is designed to minimize costs and software complexity for writing to L1."
"89", "Why is the wire format in Bedrock important?", "The wire format in Bedrock is important because it helps to minimize costs and reduce software complexity when writing transactions to L1. This makes the system more efficient and cost-effective."
"90", "How does Optimism optimize data compression for transactions?", "Optimism organizes lists of L2 transactions into groups called sequencer batches, which are then grouped into objects called channels. These channels have a maximum size and are compressed before being submitted to the L1."
"90", "What is the maximum size of a channel in Optimism?", "The maximum size of a channel in Optimism is initially set to approximately 9.5Mb, as defined in a configurable parameter."
"90", "Where can I find more technical details about the channel format in Optimism?", "You can find more technical details about the channel format in Optimism in the documentation available at this [link](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/65ec61dde94ffa93342728d324fecf474d228e1f/specs/derivation.md#channel-format)."
"91", "How does Optimism handle large amounts of data when sending it to Ethereum's Layer 1?", "Optimism breaks down large amounts of data into smaller chunks called channel frames. These frames are compressed and can fit inside a single L1 transaction, allowing them to be sent in parallel. This minimizes the complexity of the sequencer software and maximizes the use of available space on L1."
"91", "Why is it beneficial for Optimism to send transactions in parallel to Ethereum's Layer 1?", "Sending transactions in parallel minimizes the complexity of the sequencer software and ensures that all available space for data on L1 is utilized efficiently. This helps in optimizing the performance and scalability of the system."
"91", "What are channel frames in the context of Optimism?", "Channel frames are chunks of compressed channel data that can fit inside a single L1 transaction. They are mutually independent and their ordering is known, which allows them to be sent in parallel to Ethereum's Layer 1."
"92", "How does Bedrock handle execution gas for L1 system transactions?", "Bedrock removes all execution gas used by the L1 system from submitting data to the L1 in transactions called batcher transactions. This means that the gas costs associated with these transactions are eliminated."
"92", "What happens to invalid batches or individual transactions within a batch in the Bedrock system?", "Invalid batches and invalid individual transactions within an otherwise valid batch are considered to be discarded and irrelevant to the system. This ensures that only valid data is processed."
"92", "What is the batch inbox address in the context of Bedrock?", "The batch inbox address is a single externally owned account (EOA) on Ethereum where batcher transactions are sent. This address is used to receive and process the batches of data."
"93", "How does the Bedrock protocol ensure the timing of deposits on L1 is respected in the L2 chain?", "The Bedrock protocol ensures the timing of deposits on L1 is respected in the L2 chain by defining strategies for guaranteeing the inclusion of deposits, handling L1 and L2 timestamps, and processing sequencing windows in a pipeline to ensure correct ordering. This is achieved through a pure function of data written to the L1 by sequencers, deposits, and L1 block attributes."
"93", "What is a pure function in the context of the Bedrock protocol?", "In the context of the Bedrock protocol, a pure function refers to a function that guarantees the timing and inclusion of deposits on the L1 chain with respect to the block derivation of the canonical L2 chain. This function relies solely on the data written to the L1 by sequencers, deposits, and L1 block attributes, ensuring consistent and predictable outcomes."
"93", "How does the Bedrock protocol handle sequencing windows?", "The Bedrock protocol handles sequencing windows by processing them in a pipeline to ensure the correct ordering of transactions. This involves strategies for guaranteeing the inclusion of deposits and managing L1 and L2 timestamps to maintain the integrity and timing of the canonical L2 chain."
"94", "How often are L2 blocks created in the Bedrock release?", "In the Bedrock release, the target configuration for the block time on L2 is 2 seconds."
"94", "What is a sequencing epoch in the context of Optimism's Bedrock release?", "A sequencing epoch in the Bedrock release is a range of L2 blocks derived from a range of L1 blocks. Each epoch is identified by an epoch number, which is equal to the block number of the first L1 block in the sequencing window."
"94", "How does the protocol ensure that deposits are processed in a logical order?", "The protocol ensures that deposits are processed in a logical order by using the timestamps of L1 blocks as anchor points for determining the order of transactions on L2. The first L2 block of an epoch must contain deposits from L1 to guarantee that deposits are processed."
"95", "How does Bedrock handle the synchronization of timestamps between L1 and L2?", "Bedrock addresses the synchronization of timestamps between L1 and L2 by allowing a short window of time for sequencing to apply timestamps on L2 transactions. This is done within a sequencing window derived from a sequence of L1 blocks."
"95", "What is a sequencing window in the context of Bedrock?", "A sequencing window is a sequence of L1 blocks from which an epoch can be derived. It contains batcher transactions for a specific epoch and includes blocks from the first L1 block number `N` to `N + SWS`, where `SWS` is the sequencer window size."
"95", "What is the purpose of the max sequencer drift in Bedrock?", "The max sequencer drift is a protocol constant that governs the maximum timestamp a block can have within its epoch. It allows the sequencer to maintain liveness in case of temporary problems connecting to L1, ensuring that each L2 block’s timestamp fits within a specific range relative to the L1 timestamp."
"96", "How does the canonical L2 chain start processing?", "The canonical L2 chain starts processing from the L2 genesis state, setting the L2 chain inception as the first epoch, and then processes all sequencing windows in order to determine the correct ordering of sequencer batches and deposits."
"96", "What is the role of L1 blocks in the L2 chain?", "L1 blocks define epochs and contain data pertaining to batcher transactions or deposits, which must be included in the canonical L2 chain."
"96", "Why is data decompressed in the L2 chain processing?", "Data is decompressed to minimize data fee costs on the L1. Channels are compressed to save on fees, so they must be decompressed before being processed into batches and then into L2 blocks."
"97", "How does Optimism ensure trustless execution of L2-to-L1 messaging?", "Optimism ensures trustless execution of L2-to-L1 messaging by writing the outputs computed from executing transactions in L2 blocks to L1. This process involves hashing the outputs in a tree-structured form to minimize the cost of proving any piece of data captured by the outputs. Proposers periodically submit output roots, which are Merkle roots of the entire canonical L2 chain, to L1."
"97", "What is the purpose of output roots in Optimism's Bedrock?", "In Optimism's Bedrock, output roots serve as Merkle roots of the entire canonical L2 chain. They are periodically submitted to L1 by proposers to ensure that the data from L2 blocks can be verified and trusted. This helps in minimizing the cost of proving any piece of data captured by the outputs."
"97", "What future upgrades are planned for the OP Stack regarding output roots?", "Future upgrades of the OP Stack are expected to include a specification for a variation of a fault proof with bonding. This will create incentives for proposers to propose correct output roots, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of the data submitted to L1."
"98", "How does Bedrock handle the separation of concerns in the Optimism network?", "Bedrock handles the separation of concerns by mirroring the technical separation specified by Ethereum. It introduces a separation between the execution client and the rollup node, similar to how Ethereum separates its execution layer and consensus layer."
"99", "What's an execution client in the context of Optimism?", "An execution client is a system that sequencers and other node operators use to determine the state of the canonical L2 chain. It also processes inbound transactions, communicates them peer-to-peer, and handles the system's state to process queries against it."
"99", "How does Bedrock in the OP Stack relate to Ethereum's execution client?", "Bedrock in the OP Stack is designed to reuse Ethereum’s own execution client specifications and its many implementations. It has demonstrated an extremely limited modification of go-ethereum, the most popular Ethereum client written in Go, with a diff of less than 2000 lines of code."
"99", "Why does Bedrock have any modifications at all to the Ethereum execution client?", "Bedrock has modifications to the Ethereum execution client to handle deposited transactions and to charge transaction fees."
"100", "How are deposited transactions represented in the Optimism rollup?", "Deposited transactions in the Optimism rollup are represented by an additional transaction type introduced specifically for this purpose."
"100", "What standard does the new transaction type for deposited transactions follow?", "The new transaction type for deposited transactions follows the EIP-2718 typed transactions standard."
"100", "What role does the execution client play in handling the new transaction type for deposited transactions?", "The execution client implements the new transaction type for deposited transactions according to the specified standards."
"101", "How are sequencer fees determined in Optimism rollups?", "Sequencer fees in Optimism rollups are computed using the same gas table as Ethereum and follow the EIP-1559 algorithm. These fees fluctuate based on the congestion of the network and go to the protocol for operating sequencers."
"101", "What are data availability fees in Optimism rollups?", "Data availability fees are costs associated with writing batcher transactions to the Layer 1 (L1). These fees cover the cost that sequencers need to pay to submit batcher transactions to the L1."
"101", "How is the data availability portion of the fee determined in Bedrock?", "In Bedrock, the data availability portion of the fee is determined based on information in a system contract on the rollup called a GasPriceOracle. This contract is updated during block derivation from the gas pricing information retrieved from the L1 block attributes that get inserted at the beginning of every epoch."
"102", "How does Bedrock achieve consensus if it doesn't use proof-of-stake like Ethereum?", "Bedrock achieves consensus through a process called block derivation. An execution client of the OP Stack communicates with a component called a rollup node, which implements block derivation. This rollup node derives the state of the system by reading data and deposits on the L1 (Layer 1)."
"102", "What is the role of a rollup node in Bedrock?", "A rollup node in Bedrock is a stateless component responsible for deriving the state of the system by reading data and deposits on the L1. It can be used to sequence incoming transactions from users or other rollup nodes, or to verify confirmed transactions posted on the L1 by relying solely on the L1."
"102", "How does the rollup node communicate with the execution client in Bedrock?", "The rollup node communicates with the execution client using the same Engine API that Ethereum uses. This allows for seamless interaction between the rollup node and the execution client."
"103", "How does a rollup node verify output roots?", "A rollup node verifies output roots by reading data from the L1 and interpreting it according to block derivation protocol rules. It ensures that any output roots shared by other nodes or posted on the L1 are correct according to the protocol definition."
"103", "What is the purpose of the simplest mode of running a rollup node?", "The simplest mode of running a rollup node is to follow the canonical L2 chain without any peers. This mode is used to read data from the L1 and verify that output roots are correct according to the protocol. It can also be used by proposers to generate the output roots they need to submit to the L1."
"103", "What does 'finalized' mean in the context of a rollup node?", "In the context of a rollup node, 'finalized' refers to the Ethereum proof-of-stake consensus, meaning the canonical and practically irreversible state. The finalized L2 head is the head of the canonical L2 chain derived only from finalized L1 blocks."
"104", "How do rollup nodes participate in a network?", "Rollup nodes participate in a network by tracking the progression and state of an L2. They read data and deposits from the L1, interpret it as blocks, and accept inbound transactions from users and peers in the network."
"104", "What is the difference between the safe L2 head and the unsafe L2 head?", "The safe L2 head represents the rollup that can be fully derived from the reference L1 chain, even if L1 has not yet finalized. The unsafe L2 head includes blocks that have not yet been derived from L1 and may come from operating the rollup node as a sequencer or from unsafe sync with the sequencer. The safe L2 head is always chosen over the unsafe L2 head in cases of disagreements."
"104", "When do nodes in the L2 network refer to the unsafe L2 head?", "For most purposes, nodes in the L2 network will refer to the unsafe L2 head for end-user applications."
"105", "How does a rollup node sequence transactions?", "A rollup node sequences transactions by creating new blocks on top of the unsafe L2 head."
"105", "What is the role of the sequencer in the OP Stack network?", "The sequencer is responsible for creating new blocks and posting batches to L1 for other nodes in the network to sync from."
"105", "How many sequencers are there per OP Stack network?", "Currently, there is only one sequencer per OP Stack network."
"106", "What's the role of a sequencer in Optimism?", "The role of a sequencer in Optimism is to produce batches. To do this, a sequencer can run rollup nodes and have separate processes that perform batching by reading from a trusted rollup node they run."
"106", "What is a batcher in the context of Optimism?", "A batcher is a component of the OP Stack that reads transaction data from a rollup node and interprets it into batcher transactions to be written to the L1 (Layer 1). The batcher is responsible for reading the unsafe L2 (Layer 2) head of a rollup node run by a sequencer, creating batcher transactions, and writing them to the L1."
"106", "How does a batcher interact with rollup nodes?", "A batcher reads transaction data from a rollup node, interprets it into batcher transactions, and then writes these transactions to the L1. It reads the unsafe L2 head of a rollup node run by a sequencer to perform these tasks."
"107", "How do the standard bridges in Optimism work?", "The standard bridges in Optimism are a pair of bridge contracts used for the most common kinds of deposits and withdrawals. They wrap the deposit and withdrawal contracts to provide simple interfaces for depositing and withdrawing ETH and ERC-20 tokens. Bridging a native token involves locking the native token in a contract and then minting an equivalent amount of a mintable token on the other side of the bridge."
"107", "What happens to a native token when it is bridged in Optimism?", "When a native token is bridged in Optimism, it is locked in a contract on one side of the bridge. An equivalent amount of a mintable token is then minted on the other side of the bridge."
"107", "What types of tokens can be deposited and withdrawn using the standard bridges in Optimism?", "The standard bridges in Optimism can be used to deposit and withdraw ETH and ERC-20 tokens."
"108", "Where is fault proof construction and verification implemented in Optimism?", "Fault proof construction and verification is implemented in the Cannon project, which you can find on GitHub."
"108", "What are the future milestones for fault proof game specification in Optimism?", "The future milestones include the specification of the fault proof game and the integration of an output root challenger into the rollup node."
"109", "Where can I find the technical details of the OP Stack?", "The technical details of the OP Stack are defined in the protocol specification, which is located in the Optimism monorepo on GitHub."
"109", "What is the most up-to-date source for understanding the inner workings of the Optimism protocol?", "The most up-to-date source for understanding the inner workings of the Optimism protocol is the protocol specification found in the Optimism monorepo on GitHub."
"110", "Where can I find detailed information about the differences between Bedrock and previous versions of the protocol?", "You can find detailed information about the differences between Bedrock and previous versions of the protocol on the 'How is Bedrock Different?' page."
"111", "What's Bedrock in the context of Optimism?", "Bedrock is the latest major release of OP Mainnet, which is part of the Optimism network."
"112", "Which sections of the Optimism Governance Documentation should a wallet developer focus on?", "A wallet developer should focus on the sections related to EIP-1559, JSON-RPC, and Block Production. These sections will help them understand transaction costs and timing, which are crucial for their users."
"112", "What information is important for a Dapp frontend developer in the Optimism Governance Documentation?", "A Dapp frontend developer should look at the sections on EIP-1559, Mempool, JSON-RPC, and Block Production. These sections cover transaction fees, changes in the RPC interface, and block timing, which are relevant for application development."
"112", "What should an infrastructure provider know from the Optimism Governance Documentation?", "An infrastructure provider should be familiar with the sections on Mempool, Block Production, Historical Data, JSON-RPC, and Chain Reorganizations. Additionally, they should refer to the detailed guide on how to run a Bedrock node."
"113", "How often are blocks produced in the Bedrock network?", "Blocks in the Bedrock network are produced every two seconds. However, this value may change in the future."
"113", "What is a system transaction in the Bedrock network?", "System transactions are created by the `op-node` and are used to execute deposits and update the Layer 2's view of Layer 1. Every block will contain at least one system transaction called the L1 attributes deposited transaction, which will always be the first transaction in the block. Some blocks may also contain user-deposited transactions. All system transactions have an EIP-2718-compatible transaction type of `0x7E` and are unsigned, with their `v`, `r`, and `s` fields set to `null`."
"113", "What should I do if my Ethereum client library cannot parse the `null` signature fields in system transactions?", "If your Ethereum client library, such as Web3j, cannot parse the `null` signature fields in system transactions, you will need to manually filter out the system transactions before passing them to the library."
"114", "How does EIP-1559 affect transaction fees on the Optimism network?", "EIP-1559 introduces a two-component fee structure: the base fee and the priority fee. The base fee varies between blocks based on demand for block space, while the priority fee is specified in the transaction and varies between transactions. Unlike Ethereum, ETH is not burned on the Optimism network."
"114", "What are the key differences in EIP-1559 parameters between Ethereum and OP Mainnet?", "Some key differences include the block gas target (5,000,000 gas on OP Mainnet vs. 15,000,000 gas on Ethereum), the EIP-1559 elasticity multiplier (6 on OP Mainnet vs. 2 on Ethereum), and the maximum base fee increase per block (10% on OP Mainnet vs. 12.5% on Ethereum). Additionally, the block time is 2 seconds on OP Mainnet compared to 12 seconds on Ethereum."
"114", "What new features does EIP-1559 introduce for application developers on the Optimism network?", "EIP-1559 introduces support for the `BASEFEE` opcode, which returns the base fee of the current block. It also supports the `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` and `eth_feeHistory` RPC methods. `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` provides an estimate of the priority fee needed to get a transaction included in the current block, while `eth_feeHistory` offers historical gas information to help decide on `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` values."
"115", "Why was the `L1BLOCKNUMBER` opcode removed in the Bedrock upgrade?", "The `L1BLOCKNUMBER` opcode was removed in the Bedrock upgrade to reduce differences between OP Mainnet's EVM and vanilla Ethereum's EVM, aiming for maximal EVM equivalence."
"116", "How were ETH balances represented in the previous version of the Optimism system?", "In the previous version of the Optimism system, ETH balances were represented using an ERC20 contract called `OVM_ETH`."
"116", "What will happen to the `OVM_ETH` balances during the migration to the Bedrock network?", "The `OVM_ETH` balances will be migrated into the Bedrock network's state as part of the migration process."
"116", "Will the methods on the `OVM_ETH` contract still work after the migration?", "Yes, to preserve backwards compatibility, the methods on the `OVM_ETH` contract will continue to work after the migration. However, the `totalSupply()` method will return zero."
"117", "How does Bedrock handle block reorganization compared to the legacy network?", "Bedrock nodes always derive blocks from L1, meaning that if L1 experiences a reorg, L2 will reorganize itself to match the state of L1. Blocks that have not been submitted to L1 yet are gossipped via a peer-to-peer network and can be reorganized if the data on L1 does not match the data gossiped over P2P."
"117", "What are the different states of blocks in Bedrock?", "In Bedrock, blocks can be in one of the following states: `unsafe`, `safe`, and `finalized`. An `unsafe` block has been received via gossip but not yet submitted to L1 and can be reorged if L1 or the sequencer reorgs. A `safe` block has been submitted to L1 and can be reorged if L1 reorgs. A `finalized` block has reached sufficient depth to be considered final and cannot be reorged."
"117", "How can I query the current state of blocks in Bedrock?", "The current `safe`, `unsafe`, and `finalized` blocks can be queried via JSON-RPC."
"118", "Do Bedrock nodes support pre-Bedrock block bodies, transactions, and receipts?", "Yes, Bedrock nodes can serve pre-Bedrock block bodies, transactions, and receipts out of the box."
"118", "What should I do if my application needs legacy fields like `queueOrigin` or `l1TxOrigin`?", "If your application needs these legacy fields, you should query a Legacy Geth instance instead of `op-geth`."
"118", "Where can I find more information about running a Legacy Geth instance?", "You can find more information about running a Legacy Geth instance in the Node Operator Guide."
"119", "How can I get the gas price for transactions on Optimism?", "For the L2 gas price, you can use the `eth_gasPrice` method. For the L1 gas price, you can call the `GasPriceOracle`'s `l1BaseFee` function."
"119", "Is there a way to check the synchronization status of an Optimism node?", "Yes, you can use the `optimism_syncStatus` RPC method to query the sync status. This method will return the current `safe`, `unsafe`, and `finalized` statuses as seen by the `op-node`."
"119", "What should I use instead of the `eth_getBlockRange` method on Bedrock?", "You should use the `eth_getBlockByNumber` method in a batch request instead of `eth_getBlockRange`."
"120", "How does Bedrock handle pending transactions?", "Bedrock uses a mempool to store pending transactions until they are included in a block. This is necessary because Bedrock creates blocks at fixed intervals."
"120", "Why is Bedrock's mempool private?", "Bedrock's mempool is private to minimize Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which can occur when miners manipulate the order of transactions for their own benefit."
"120", "How are transactions processed in Bedrock's mempool?", "Transactions in Bedrock's mempool are processed by the sequencer in order of their base and priority fees."
"121", "How long does it take to finalize a withdrawal on the legacy network?", "On the legacy network, it takes seven days to finalize a withdrawal after sending a withdrawal message."
"121", "What is the main security improvement introduced by Bedrock for withdrawals?", "Bedrock requires users to post their withdrawal proofs upfront, which allows onchain monitoring tools to detect and attempt corrective action against fraudulent withdrawal proofs."
"121", "Is the new Bedrock withdrawal process backwards-compatible with the old network?", "No, the new Bedrock withdrawal process is not backwards-compatible with the old network. Users will need to update their software if they are performing withdrawals outside the standard bridge interface."
"122", "Will the changes in the new Bedrock network be compatible with the old network?", "No, the changes in the Bedrock network are not backwards-compatible with the old network."
"122", "What happens to deposits on the legacy network that have not been replayed before the migration?", "Deposits on the legacy network that have not been replayed will no longer be replayable after the migration to Bedrock."
"122", "How many transactions on the mainnet are affected by the need to replay deposits before the migration?", "Fewer than 100 transactions out of nearly 40 million on the mainnet are affected by the need to replay deposits before the migration."
"123", "What's the purpose of the `L2OutputOracle` contract in Optimism?", "The `L2OutputOracle` contract contains the state root of the Optimism blockchain, such as OP Mainnet and OP Goerli. It will also receive the result of the fault proof process once fault proofs are activated."
"123", "What did the `L2OutputOracle` contract replace in the Optimism system?", "The `L2OutputOracle` contract replaced the old State Commitment Chain in the Optimism system."
"124", "How can I send messages between L1 and L2 in Optimism?", "You can send messages between L1 and L2 using the L1CrossDomainMessenger and L2CrossDomainMessenger. This is the recommended method unless you need to send L2 transactions via L1 to bypass the sequencer."
"124", "What is the purpose of the OptimismPortal contract?", "The OptimismPortal contract provides the low-level API for communications between layers, such as deposits from the underlying L1 Ethereum (Goerli, etc.) to L2 (OP Mainnet, OP Goerli, etc.)."
"125", "Do I need to modify my dapp to run on Bedrock?", "No, you don't need to modify your dapp to run on Bedrock because the contracts provide the same interface as existed pre-Bedrock."
"125", "What is the purpose of the L1CrossDomainMessenger contract?", "The L1CrossDomainMessenger contract is used for sending messages between the underlying L1 (like Ethereum, Goerli) and L2 (like OP Mainnet, OP Goerli). These messages may or may not have assets attached to them."
"125", "How does the L1StandardBridge contract work?", "The L1StandardBridge contract uses the L1CrossDomainMessenger to transfer ETH and ERC-20 tokens between the underlying L1 (like Ethereum, Goerli) and L2 (like OP Mainnet, OP Goerli)."
"126", "How can I find the address of the `L1Block` contract in Optimism?", "The `L1Block` contract in Optimism is located at the address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015`."
"126", "What kind of information can I retrieve from the `L1Block` contract?", "You can retrieve several parameters from the `L1Block` contract using getter functions, including the latest L1 block number (`number`), the timestamp of the latest L1 block (`timestamp`), the base fee of the latest L1 block (`basefee`), the hash of the latest L1 block (`hash`), and the number of the L2 block within the epoch (`sequenceNumber`)."
"126", "Why is there a delay in the L1 information in Optimism?", "The L1 information is delayed by two block confirmations, which is approximately 24 seconds, to minimize the impact of reorgs (reorganizations) on the network."
"127", "How does the SequencerFeeVault contract fund the sequencer on L1?", "The SequencerFeeVault contract funds the sequencer on L1 using the ETH base fee collected on L2."
"127", "What mechanism is used to calculate the fees for the SequencerFeeVault contract?", "The fees for the SequencerFeeVault contract are calculated using EIP 1559, the same mechanism that Ethereum uses, but with different parameter values."
"128", "How does the `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract function in the Optimism network?", "The `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract is used internally by the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` to initiate withdrawals from Layer 2 (L2) to Layer 1 (L1)."
"128", "Are there different versions of the `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract in Optimism's Bedrock?", "Yes, in Bedrock there are two versions of the contract: the legacy contract at address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000000` and the new contract at address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000016`."
"128", "Where can I find the code for the `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract?", "You can find the code for the `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract on GitHub at this [link](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/65ec61dde94ffa93342728d324fecf474d228e1f/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol)."
"129", "Do I need to modify my dapp to run on Bedrock?", "No, you don't need to modify your dapp to run on Bedrock because the contracts provide the same interface as existed pre-Bedrock."

"131", "What's the difference between a deposit and a withdrawal in Optimism?", "In Optimism, a 'deposit' refers to any message going from the underlying L1 blockchain to L2, whether it has any assets attached or not. A 'withdrawal' refers to any message going from L2 to the underlying L1."
"131", "Do deposits in Optimism always involve transferring assets?", "No, in Optimism, a 'deposit' can refer to any message going from the underlying L1 blockchain to L2, whether it has any assets attached or not."
"131", "What does a withdrawal mean in the context of Optimism?", "In the context of Optimism, a 'withdrawal' refers to any message going from L2 to the underlying L1 blockchain."
"132", "Will the gas costs for communication between layers change?", "Yes, the gas costs for communication between layers are expected to change and will probably get lower. More detailed information will be provided once the test network has been profiled."
"132", "When will we get more information about the new gas costs?", "More information will be posted once the team has more exact data after profiling a test network."
"133", "How can I ensure my deposit transaction on Optimism doesn't run out of gas?", "To ensure your deposit transaction doesn't run out of gas, you should add a 50% buffer to the gas estimate returned by `estimateGas`. For example, if `eth_estimateGas` estimates that your deposit will consume 100,000 gas, you should multiply this by 1.5 and set your `gasLimit` to at least 150,000 gas. The Optimism SDK already does this automatically."
"133", "What happens if the sequencer is down when I make a deposit on Optimism?", "If the sequencer is down, you can still make deposits using the OptimismPortal’s `depositTransaction` function. Verifiers, which are nodes that synchronize the Optimism state from L1, will receive these transactions and modify the state accordingly. When the sequencer is back up, it will process the transactions in the same order to maintain a valid state."
"133", "How long does it take for a deposit to be confirmed on Optimism?", "Deposits on Optimism are faster and typically take about a minute to be confirmed because they only require five blocks for confirmation, with L1 blocks usually being 12 seconds apart."
"134", "What are some of the changes in Optimism internals?", "The section discusses various updates and modifications made to the internal workings of Optimism, although specific details are not provided in the fragment."

"145", "How does Bedrock handle pending transactions?", "Bedrock creates blocks on a fixed interval and uses a private mempool to store pending transactions until they are included in a block."
"145", "How are transactions processed in Bedrock's mempool?", "The sequencer processes transactions in the mempool in order of their base and priority fees."
"145", "How do I submit transactions in Bedrock?", "To submit transactions in Bedrock, you need to configure `op-geth` to forward transactions to the sequencer."
"146", "How long does it take to finalize a withdrawal on the legacy network?", "On the legacy network, it takes seven days for the withdrawal to be finalized after the user sends a withdrawal message."
"146", "What is the main security improvement in the Bedrock update for withdrawals?", "The main security improvement in the Bedrock update is that users must post their withdrawal proofs upfront, allowing onchain monitoring tools to detect and address any fraudulent withdrawal proofs before the funds are claimed."
"146", "Is the new Bedrock withdrawal process backwards-compatible with the old network?", "No, the new Bedrock withdrawal process is not backwards-compatible with the old network. Users performing withdrawals outside the standard bridge interface will need to update their software, and the easiest way to do this is by using the provided TypeScript SDK."
"147", "Will the changes in the new network be compatible with the old network?", "No, the changes described are not backwards-compatible with the old network. It is important to read the section carefully to understand the implications."
"147", "What happens to deposits on the legacy network that have not been replayed?", "Deposits on the legacy network that have not been replayed will no longer be replayable after the migration to Bedrock. You must replay your deposit before the migration."
"147", "How many transactions on the mainnet are affected by this change?", "Fewer than 100 transactions out of nearly 40 million on the mainnet are affected by this change."
"148", "What's the purpose of the `L2OutputOracle` contract in Optimism?", "The `L2OutputOracle` contract contains the state root of the Optimism blockchain, such as OP Mainnet and OP Goerli. It will also receive the result of the fault proof process once fault proofs are activated."
"148", "What did the `L2OutputOracle` contract replace in the Optimism system?", "The `L2OutputOracle` contract replaced the old State Commitment Chain in the Optimism system."
"149", "How can I send messages between L1 and L2 in Optimism?", "You can send messages between L1 and L2 using the L1CrossDomainMessenger and L2CrossDomainMessenger. This is the recommended method unless you need to send L2 transactions via L1 to bypass the sequencer."
"149", "What is the purpose of the OptimismPortal contract?", "The OptimismPortal contract provides the low-level API for communications between layers, such as deposits from the underlying L1 Ethereum Goerli to L2 OP Mainnet or OP Goerli."
"149", "Is it necessary to use the OptimismPortal contract for sending L2 transactions via L1?", "No, it is not necessary unless you are specifically trying to bypass the sequencer. For most use cases, it is recommended to use the L1CrossDomainMessenger and L2CrossDomainMessenger for sending messages between L1 and L2."
"150", "Do I need to modify my dapp to run on Bedrock?", "No, the contracts provide the same interface as existed pre-Bedrock, so dapps don’t have to be modified to run on Bedrock."
"150", "What is the purpose of the L1CrossDomainMessenger contract?", "The L1CrossDomainMessenger contract is used for sending messages between the underlying L1 (Ethereum, Goerli, etc.) and L2 (OP Mainnet, OP Goerli, etc.). These messages may or may not have assets attached to them."
"150", "How does the L1StandardBridge contract work?", "The L1StandardBridge contract uses the L1CrossDomainMessenger to transfer ETH and ERC-20 tokens between the underlying L1 (Ethereum, Goerli, etc.) and L2 (OP Mainnet, OP Goerli, etc.)."
"151", "How can I find the address of the `L1Block` contract in Optimism?", "The `L1Block` contract in Optimism is located at the address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015`."
"151", "What kind of information can I retrieve from the `L1Block` contract?", "You can retrieve several parameters from the `L1Block` contract using getter functions, including the latest L1 block number (`number`), the timestamp of the latest L1 block (`timestamp`), the base fee of the latest L1 block (`basefee`), the hash of the latest L1 block (`hash`), and the number of the L2 block within the epoch (`sequenceNumber`)."
"151", "Why is there a delay in the L1 information provided by the `L1Block` contract?", "The L1 information is delayed by two block confirmations, which is approximately 24 seconds, to minimize the impact of reorgs (reorganizations) on the blockchain."
"152", "How does the `SequencerFeeVault` contract fund the sequencer on L1?", "The `SequencerFeeVault` contract funds the sequencer on L1 by using the ETH base fee collected on L2."
"152", "How are the fees calculated for the `SequencerFeeVault` contract?", "The fees for the `SequencerFeeVault` contract are calculated using the EIP 1559 mechanism, which is the same mechanism used by Ethereum, but with different parameter values."
"153", "How does the `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract function in the Optimism network?", "The `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract is used internally by the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` to initiate withdrawals from Layer 2 (L2) to Layer 1 (L1)."
"153", "Are there different versions of the `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract in Optimism?", "Yes, in the Bedrock update, there are two versions of the contract: the legacy contract at address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000000` and the new contract at address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000016`."
"153", "Where can I find the code for the `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract?", "You can find the code for the `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract on GitHub. The legacy contract is available [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/65ec61dde94ffa93342728d324fecf474d228e1f/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/legacy/LegacyMessagePasser.sol) and the new contract is available [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/65ec61dde94ffa93342728d324fecf474d228e1f/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol)."
"154", "Do I need to modify my dapp to run on Bedrock?", "No, you don't need to modify your dapp to run on Bedrock because the contracts provide the same interface as existed pre-Bedrock."
"154", "What is the purpose of the L2CrossDomainMessenger contract?", "The L2CrossDomainMessenger contract is used to send messages from L2 (like OP Mainnet or OP Goerli) to the underlying L1 (like Ethereum or Goerli)."
"154", "What does the L2StandardBridge contract do?", "The L2StandardBridge contract is used to 'attach' assets, such as ETH and ERC-20 tokens, to messages that are then sent by the L2CrossDomainMessenger."
