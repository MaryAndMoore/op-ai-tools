It consists of communities, companies, and citizens united by the principle that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual."
"10", "What is the Superchain in the context of Optimism?", "The Superchain is a vision for a horizontally scalable network of chains that share security, a communication layer, and the OP Stack as an open-source development stack. It does not yet exist, but several chains like OP Mainnet, Base, Public Goods Network, and Zora Network have opted into this vision and will inherit Superchain features when it launches."
"10", "What is the OP token and how should it be discussed?", "The OP token is a governance token used within the Optimism ecosystem. It should be referred to as 'OP' and not '$OP.' Discussions about the token should not include its price, speculation on its price, or references to it as an investment. Token grants in OP are allocations of governance authority and should not be converted to or referred to in USD amounts."
"11", "How can I start contributing to the Optimism codebase?", "You can start contributing to the Optimism codebase by reporting issues, participating in the Bug Bounty programme, fixing and responding to existing issues, and working on open bounties on Gitcoin. For beginners, it's recommended to start with issues tagged as 'good first issue'."
"11", "What skills are needed to contribute to the Optimism codebase?", "The Optimism codebase requires a variety of skills including NodeJS and TypeScript, Solidity and EVM, Go and Geth, as well as Docker and Kubernetes. Different packages within the codebase may require different skill sets."

This guide will help you get familiar with the core steps required to get a contract deployed to the network."
"12", "Is deploying a contract on OP Mainnet different from deploying on Ethereum?", "No, deploying a contract on OP Mainnet is not different from deploying on Ethereum. OP Mainnet is EVM equivalent, which means it's 100% the same as deploying a contract to Ethereum."
"12", "Where can I get help if I can't find the content I'm looking for in the documentation?", "If you can't find the content you're looking for in the documentation, you can try searching through the documentation using the search bar at the top right. If you still come up short, you can ask a question in Discord, check the Help Center, or make an issue on GitHub."
"13", "What's Bedrock in the context of Optimism?", "Bedrock is the first official release of the OP Stack, which is a set of free and open-source modular components that work together to power blockchains such as OP Mainnet."
"13", "How does Bedrock improve transaction fees?", "Bedrock reduces transaction fees by implementing optimized data compression and using Ethereum as a data availability layer. It also removes all L1 execution gas, reducing L1 data fees to the theoretical minimum, which further reduces fees by an additional 10% over the previous version."
"13", "What are the benefits of Bedrock for deposit times?", "Bedrock significantly reduces the amount of time users need to wait for deposits by introducing support for L1 re-orgs in the node software. Earlier versions could take up to 10 minutes to confirm deposits, but with Bedrock, deposits are expected to confirm within 3 minutes."
"14", "What's the latest major release of OP Mainnet called?", "The latest major release of OP Mainnet is called Bedrock."
"14", "What is the block production time in the Bedrock network?", "In the Bedrock network, blocks are produced every two seconds. However, this value may change in the future."
"14", "How does the Bedrock upgrade affect transaction fees?", "The Bedrock upgrade introduces EIP-1559, which changes the way transaction fees are calculated. The cost of a unit of gas is composed of a base fee and a priority fee. The base fee varies between blocks based on demand, while the priority fee is specified in the transaction itself. Additionally, the L1 security fee should be reduced by about 20% due to improved compression and other changes."
"15", "What's the latest major release of OP Mainnet called?", "The latest major release of OP Mainnet is called Bedrock."
"15", "What are some key changes introduced in the Bedrock upgrade?", "The Bedrock upgrade introduces several key changes, including a fixed block production time of every two seconds, support for EIP-1559, the introduction of system transactions, and a new two-phase withdrawal process to enhance security."
"15", "How does the Bedrock upgrade affect transaction fees?", "With the Bedrock upgrade, the cost of a unit of gas is composed of a base fee and a priority fee. The base fee varies between blocks based on demand, while the priority fee is specified in the transaction itself. Additionally, the L1 security fee should be reduced by about 20% due to improved compression and other changes."
"16", "What's the main purpose of the Bedrock release in the Optimism OP Stack?", "Bedrock is the first official release of the OP Stack, which is a set of free and open-source modular components designed to power blockchains like OP Mainnet. It aims to improve transaction fees, reduce deposit times, enable modular proof systems, and enhance node performance."
"16", "How does Bedrock reduce transaction fees?", "Bedrock reduces transaction fees by implementing an optimized data compression strategy and removing all L1 execution gas, which minimizes data costs and reduces fees by an additional 10% over the previous version of the protocol."
"16", "What improvements does Bedrock bring to deposit times?", "Bedrock introduces support for L1 re-orgs in the node software, significantly reducing the time users need to wait for deposits. Deposits that previously took up to 10 minutes to confirm are now expected to confirm within 3 minutes."
"17", "What's the main purpose of the Bedrock upgrade for OP Mainnet?", "The Bedrock upgrade is the latest major release for OP Mainnet, introducing several changes to improve the network's performance and compatibility with Ethereum. Key changes include a fixed block production time of every two seconds, support for EIP-1559, and the introduction of system transactions."
"17", "How does the Bedrock upgrade affect transaction fees on OP Mainnet?", "With the Bedrock upgrade, OP Mainnet now supports EIP-1559, which changes how transaction fees are calculated. The cost of gas is composed of a base fee, which varies between blocks based on demand, and a priority fee, which is specified in the transaction itself. Unlike Ethereum, ETH is not burned on OP Mainnet, and some EIP-1559 parameters differ, such as the block gas target and elasticity multiplier."
"17", "What is the new process for withdrawing funds from OP Mainnet after the Bedrock upgrade?", "The Bedrock upgrade introduces a two-phase withdrawal process to enhance security. Users must first send a withdrawal message and wait for a state output to be proposed onchain. Then, they post and validate their withdrawal proof using the `proveWithdrawalTransaction()` function. After a seven-day waiting period, users can finalize the withdrawal and claim their funds using the `finalizeWithdrawal()` function."
"18", "How can I enable metrics for my `op-node` in Optimism?", "To enable metrics for your `op-node`, you need to pass the `--metrics.enabled` flag when starting the `op-node`. You can also customize the metrics port and address using the `--metrics.port` and `--metrics.addr` flags, respectively."
"18", "What is the default endpoint for accessing `op-node` metrics?", "The default endpoint for accessing `op-node` metrics is `http://localhost:7300/metrics`."
"18", "What should I monitor to ensure my `op-node` is syncing properly?", "To ensure your `op-node` is syncing properly, you should monitor the following metrics: `op_node_default_refs_number` (to check if the node is syncing or reorging), `op_node_default_peer_count` (to ensure the node has enough peers to sync unsafe blocks), and `op_node_default_rpc_client_request_duration_seconds` (to identify any slow RPC methods that might be affecting sync performance)."
"19", "How do the Rollup Node and Execution Engine communicate in an Optimism Bedrock deployment?", "The Rollup Node and Execution Engine communicate with each other over JSON-RPC via the Engine API. The Rollup Node functions as Optimism's consensus client, and the Execution Engine as its execution client."
"19", "What are the minimum system requirements to run Bedrock?", "The minimum system requirements to run Bedrock are: for `op-node`, 2 CPUs and 4GB RAM with no storage necessary; for `op-geth`, 4 CPUs, 8GB RAM, and at least 40GB of SSD storage for OP Goerli or OP Sepolia, and at least 600GB of SSD storage for mainnet."
"19", "Do I need to run Legacy Geth for all Optimism networks?", "No, you only need to run Legacy Geth for OP Mainnet and OP Goerli to serve historical execution traces for transactions prior to the Bedrock upgrade. It is not required for OP Sepolia."
"20", "Where can I find information about the Optimism Goerli network?", "You can find information about the Optimism Goerli network by visiting the 'useful-tools/networks' section of the Optimism Governance Documentation."
"21", "Where can I find more detailed information about Bedrock Mission Control for Optimism?", "You can find more detailed information about Bedrock Mission Control for Optimism by visiting this link: https://oplabs.notion.site/Bedrock-Mission-Control-EXTERNAL-fca344b1f799447cb1bcf3aae62157c5"
"22", "How has the Bedrock release affected transaction statuses in Optimism?", "In the Bedrock release, transactions can now be in one of three statuses: 'unsafe', 'safe', and 'finalized'. 'Unsafe' means the block has been received but not yet submitted to L1 and can be reorged. 'Safe' means the block has been submitted to L1 but can still be reorged if L1 reorgs. 'Finalized' means the block has reached sufficient depth to be considered final and cannot be reorged."
"22", "What changes have been made to transaction fees in the Bedrock release?", "In the Bedrock release, transaction fees now account for EIP 1559 support. This means the L2 execution fee is composed of a fixed base fee and a user-selected priority fee. The base fee can vary significantly within a short period, and it is recommended to set a higher base fee to ensure transaction acceptance. The priority fee is the amount the user pays and should be kept as low as possible."
"22", "What should I do if a JSON RPC method I used before is no longer available in Bedrock?", "If a JSON RPC method you used before has been removed in Bedrock, you may need to use an alternative method. For example, 'eth_getBlockRange' has been removed, and you should use 'eth_getBlockByNumber' in a batch request instead. For 'rollup_gasPrices', you can use 'eth_gasPrice' for the L2 gas price and the 'GasPriceOracle's l1BaseFee' function for the L1 gas price. Some methods, like 'rollup_getInfo', have no direct replacement."
"23", "How can I move tokens between OP Mainnet and Ethereum?", "You can move tokens between OP Mainnet and Ethereum using the Standard Token Bridge. It's a simple smart contract designed to facilitate the transfer of tokens between the two networks and allows you to create L2 representations of existing tokens on Ethereum."
"23", "Is it possible to send data between OP Mainnet and Ethereum?", "Yes, you can send arbitrary data between OP Mainnet and Ethereum. This functionality allows a contract on Ethereum to trigger a contract function on OP Mainnet and vice versa, using a simple API for cross-chain function calls."
"23", "What is bridging in the context of OP Mainnet and Ethereum?", "Bridging refers to the process of moving data and assets between OP Mainnet and Ethereum. This is commonly done by app developers who need to transfer tokens or other data between the two networks."
"24", "How can I ensure the L2 state is correct before the fault challenge period passes?", "To ensure the L2 state is correct before the fault challenge period passes, you should run a replica yourself. This helps you verify the state you are using is accurate."
"24", "What are the trade-offs of using a fully centralized communication strategy for my dapp?", "Using a fully centralized communication strategy for your dapp offers the fastest speed and the cheapest cost. However, it comes with the trade-off of being centralized, meaning you have to trust a single server to handle the communication."
"24", "What is the process for sending messages from L2 to L1?", "Sending messages from L2 to L1 requires three transactions: an initiating transaction on L2, a proving transaction on L1 (which includes a merkle proof and is expensive), and a claiming transaction on L1 after the fault challenge period passes. This process takes more than 7 days and is costly."
"25", "How can apps on OP Mainnet interact with apps on Ethereum?", "Apps on OP Mainnet can interact with apps on Ethereum via a process called 'bridging'. This allows contracts on OP Mainnet to trigger contract functions on Ethereum, and vice versa."
"25", "What are the 'messenger' contracts used for in Optimism?", "The 'messenger' contracts are special smart contracts that enable communication between Layer 1 (Ethereum) and Layer 2 (OP Mainnet). Each layer has its own messenger contract which abstracts away lower-level communication details. The key function used in these contracts is `sendMessage`."
"25", "How long does it take for transactions to be sent from OP Mainnet to Ethereum?", "Transactions from OP Mainnet (L2) to Ethereum (L1) have to wait for two periods: the time until the state root is written to L1 and the fault challenge period, which is seven days on mainnet. This waiting period is a core part of the security mechanism designed to keep funds on Optimism secure."
"26", "How can I transfer my ERC20 tokens between Layer 1 and Layer 2 on Optimism?", "You can transfer your ERC20 tokens between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) on Optimism using the Standard Bridge. This involves depositing your tokens on L1, where they are locked, and receiving an equivalent amount on L2. You can also withdraw tokens from L2 back to L1 in a similar manner."
"26", "What should I be aware of when using the Standard Bridge for ERC20 tokens?", "When using the Standard Bridge for ERC20 tokens, you must ensure that the tokens are properly configured for the bridge. The bridge does not support certain ERC-20 configurations like fee on transfer tokens or tokens that modify balances without emitting a Transfer event. Additionally, you need to approve the Standard Token Bridge to use the amount of tokens you want to deposit, or the deposit will fail."
"26", "Can I use the Standard Bridge to transfer ETH between Layer 1 and Layer 2?", "Yes, you can use the Standard Bridge to transfer ETH between Layer 1 and Layer 2. ETH deposits can be triggered via the `depositETH` and `depositETHTo` functions on the L1StandardBridge, or by sending ETH directly to the L1StandardBridge. Once the deposit is detected and finalized on OP Mainnet, your account will be funded with the corresponding amount of ETH on L2."
"27", "How does the cost of using a decentralized application on OP Mainnet compare to using one on L1 Ethereum?", "The cost of using a decentralized application on OP Mainnet is much lower than the cost of using an equivalent application on L1 Ethereum."
"27", "What are the components of the transaction fees on OP Mainnet?", "The transaction fees on OP Mainnet are composed of two components: the L2 execution fee, which is proportional to the gas used in processing the transaction, and the L1 data fee, which is proportional to the gas cost of writing the transaction's data to L1 and the cost of gas on L1."
"27", "Why is it important to optimize the ABI (application binary interface) when using OP Mainnet?", "Optimizing the ABI is important because the standard ABI was designed with L1 tradeoffs in mind, which are not optimal for OP Mainnet. By creating a shorter ABI with just the required bytes and decoding it onchain, you can significantly reduce transaction costs."
"28", "Why would I need to run a local development environment for OP Mainnet?", "Running a local development environment for OP Mainnet is useful if you're building contracts on both OP Mainnet and Ethereum that need to interact with each other, or if your application might be subject to differences between Ethereum and OP Mainnet. It allows you to quickly test interactions and ensure everything runs as expected before moving to a testnet or mainnet deployment."
"28", "What tools and components do I need to install to set up a local development environment for OP Mainnet?", "To set up a local development environment for OP Mainnet, you need to install the command line utilities 'make' and 'jq', the Go programming language, Docker (engine version), and the Optimism monorepo. Specific installation commands are provided for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, but other OSes or versions may use different tools."
"28", "How do I start and stop the local development environment for OP Mainnet?", "To start the local development environment, run 'make devnet-up' in the root directory of the Optimism monorepo. To stop it, run 'make devnet-down'. If you need to clean everything, run 'make devnet-clean' in the same directory."
"29", "Are there any differences in transaction costs between Ethereum and OP Mainnet?", "Yes, transaction costs on OP Mainnet include both an L2 execution fee and an L1 data fee. The L2 execution fee is calculated using EIP-1559, which has different parameters on OP Mainnet compared to Ethereum. For example, the block gas target on OP Mainnet is 5,000,000 gas, while on Ethereum it is 15,000,000 gas."
"29", "What is address aliasing and why is it important on OP Mainnet?", "Address aliasing is a mechanism used on OP Mainnet to prevent trust issues that can arise when a contract on L1 and L2 share the same address but have different bytecode. This can break trust assumptions because one contract may be trusted and another may not be. Address aliasing modifies the `tx.origin` and `msg.sender` values to ensure that transactions from L1 contracts do not misuse allowances or permissions granted to L2 contracts."
"29", "How can I access information from the latest L1 block while working on OP Mainnet?", "You can access information from the latest L1 block using the `L1Block` contract, which is predeployed at address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015` on OP Mainnet. This contract provides getter functions to retrieve parameters such as the latest L1 block number, timestamp, base fee, hash, and sequence number."
"30", "How can I get the output root at a specific block on the OP Mainnet?", "You can get the output root at a specific block by using the `optimism_outputAtBlock` RPC method. You need to send a POST request with the block number as a parameter. For example, you can use the following curl command:
"30", ```sh
"30", curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data  \
"30", '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_outputAtBlock","params":["<block_number>"],"id":1}' \
"30", http://localhost:9545
"30", ```"
"30", "How do I check the synchronization status of my rollup node?", "You can check the synchronization status of your rollup node by using the `optimism_syncStatus` RPC method. You need to send a POST request without any parameters. For example, you can use the following curl command:
"30", ```sh
"30", curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data \
"30", '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_syncStatus","params":[],"id":1}'  \
"30", http://localhost:9545
"30", ```"
"30", "What is the method to get the software version of the OP Mainnet implementation?", "You can get the software version of the OP Mainnet implementation by using the `optimism_version` RPC method. You need to send a POST request without any parameters. For example, you can use the following curl command:
"30", ```sh
"30", curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data \
"30", '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_version","params":[],"id":1}' \
"30", http://localhost:9545
"30", ```"
"31", "Where can I find information about setting up nodes for Optimism?", "You can find information about setting up nodes for Optimism in the 'Developers' section under 'Nodes' in the Optimism Governance Documentation. Specifically, you can start with the introduction page at /docs/developers/nodes/intro."
"32", "How can I find the addresses of OP Mainnet contracts?", "You can find the addresses of OP Mainnet contracts by checking the Networks and Connection Details page or by looking in the deployments folder of the contracts package on the Optimism GitHub repository."
"32", "How do I install the package needed to interact with OP Mainnet contracts in a JavaScript or TypeScript project?", "You can install the package by running the command `npm install @eth-optimism/contracts` in your project directory."
"32", "How can I get the ABI and bytecode for an OP Mainnet contract?", "You can get the ABI and bytecode for an OP Mainnet contract by using the `getContractDefinition` function from the `@eth-optimism/contracts` package. For example: 
"32", ```ts
"32", import { getContractDefinition } from '@eth-optimism/contracts'
"32", const artifact = getContractDefinition('SomeOptimismContract')
"32", const abi = artifact.abi
"32", const bytecode = artifact.bytecode
"32", const deployedBytecode = artifact.deployedBytecode
"32", ```"
"33", "How is testing decentralized applications on OP Mainnet different from testing on Ethereum?", "For the most part, running applications on OP Mainnet is identical to running them on Ethereum, so the testing is also similar. However, there are some best practices for OP Mainnet testing where differences exist. For example, while most tests can be run in the development stack for efficiency, some tests that rely on OP Mainnet-specific features should be run on an OP test network or a local development environment."
"33", "What should I do if my decentralized application relies on other contracts like Uniswap?", "If your decentralized application requires the services of other contracts, you can use mainnet forking, which works with OP Mainnet. Alternatively, you can connect to the OP test network if those contracts are also deployed there."
"33", "When should I use a local development environment for testing my dapp on OP Mainnet?", "You should use a local development environment for testing if your decentralized application needs OP Mainnet-specific features that aren't available in the development stack. For example, if your dapp relies on inter-domain communication, it might be more efficient to run automated tests in a local development environment rather than developing a stub for the development stack."
"34", "How do transaction fees on OP Mainnet compare to those on Ethereum?", "Transaction fees on OP Mainnet work similarly to those on Ethereum, but with some differences due to Layer 2 paradigms. OP Mainnet has two types of fees: the L2 execution fee, which is generally lower than Ethereum's gas fees, and the L1 data fee, which covers the cost of publishing transactions to Ethereum for security purposes."
"34", "What are the two main costs associated with transactions on OP Mainnet?", "The two main costs for transactions on OP Mainnet are the L2 execution fee and the L1 data/security fee. The L2 execution fee is similar to Ethereum's gas fee and is calculated based on the amount of computation and storage used. The L1 data fee covers the cost of submitting transactions to Ethereum and is influenced by Ethereum's gas prices and the size of the transaction."
"34", "How can I estimate the total transaction fee on OP Mainnet?", "To estimate the total transaction fee on OP Mainnet, you need to calculate both the L2 execution fee and the L1 data fee. The L2 execution fee can be estimated by multiplying the gas price by the gas limit, similar to Ethereum. The L1 data fee can be estimated using the GasPriceOracle predeployed smart contract or the provided SDK. The total fee is the sum of these two estimates."
"35", "Why might my transaction get stuck on the Optimism network?", "Your transaction might get stuck if the maximum fee per gas specified by your transaction is less than the block base fee. This happens because the transaction won't be included until the base fee drops below the value specified in your transaction. No funds are lost, but the transaction does not clear on its own."
"35", "What can I do if my transaction is stuck on the Optimism network?", "If your transaction is stuck, you can submit another transaction with the same nonce value to either cancel it or increase its base fee. You can find more detailed instructions on how to do this in the Optimism help center."
"35", "Why don't deposit transactions on Optimism have a chainID?", "Deposit transactions on Optimism don't have a chainID because they are added to the L2 blockchain as part of the block derivation process and come from a dummy address without a signature. Since the chainID is encoded as part of the signature in Ethereum, there is no recoverable chainID for these transactions. This is not a problem because the only source of deposit transactions is the block derivation process, so there shouldn't be a need to recover the chainID."
"36", "Where can I find videos to help me get started with developing on OP Mainnet?", "You can find a series of developer videos that cover various topics such as deploying a contract on OP Goerli, interacting with an OP Goerli contract, using the Etherscan block explorer with OP Goerli, and more. These videos are listed under the 'Getting started with OP Mainnet' section in the Optimism Governance Documentation."
"36", "What topics were covered by OP Labs' CEO Liam Horne at ETHDenver 2023?", "Liam Horne participated in a panel discussion on how Layer 2 solutions (L2s) are scaling Ethereum for global adoption. The panel included other notable figures from the blockchain community and was moderated by Molly from Protocol Labs."
"36", "What is the OP Stack and what does the Bedrock release enable?", "The OP Stack is chain software discussed by Karl Floersch during the ETHOnline 2022 Optimism Summit. The Bedrock release of the OP Stack will enable deployments of op-chains that serve new use cases, are future-proof, and will eventually fit together to form the Superchain."
"37", "How much RAM is recommended for building an Optimism node?", "It is recommended to have at least 16 GB of RAM for building an Optimism node."
"37", "What storage capacity is needed for an OP Mainnet node?", "For an OP Mainnet node, it is recommended to have a 2TB SSD, as the current archive node usage is around 1TB."
"37", "What software do I need to install to build an Optimism node?", "You need to install Git, Go, nvm, Node, Pnpm, Foundry, Make, jq, direnv, and zstd to build an Optimism node."
"38", "How much storage space do I need to download the data directory for `op-geth`?", "You will need 500+ GB of storage space to download the data directory for `op-geth`."
"38", "Why is it important to check the validity of the downloaded data directory?", "It is important to check the validity of the downloaded data directory to ensure it is not corrupted. Corrupted data directories will make your node fail, so you need to ensure your checksum matches the expected output."
"38", "What should I do if I want to reduce the chance of my data directory being corrupted during download?", "You can use a tool like aria2 to reduce the chance of your data directory being corrupted during the download process."
"39", "How do I initialize OP Sepolia?", "OP Sepolia is a non-migrated network, so it requires initialization via a genesis file. You need to download the genesis JSON file and then run a command to initialize the data directory. The command is: 
"39", ```bash
"39", curl -o <path to genesis JSON> -sL https://networks.optimism.io/op-sepolia/genesis.json
"39", geth init \
"39", --datadir="<your data directory>" \
"39", "<path to genesis JSON>"
"39", ```"
"39", "What is the difference between migrated and non-migrated networks in Optimism?", "Migrated networks, such as OP Mainnet and OP Goerli, were running before the Bedrock upgrade and require initializing their nodes with a data directory. Non-migrated networks, like OP Sepolia, have only existed after the Bedrock upgrade and can be initialized from a genesis file."
"39", "How can I estimate the time it will take to synchronize my node?", "To estimate the synchronization time, you can use a script to calculate how many blocks are synchronized per minute. The script will also estimate the total time required based on the current synchronization speed. You need to create and run a script named `run-estimate.sh` with the provided code snippet, and then execute it to get the estimated time."
"40", "Where can I find the latest releases for Optimism?", "You can find the latest releases for Optimism on their GitHub page at this URL: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases."
"41", "Who are the members of the Optimism Collective?", "The Optimism Collective is made up of companies, communities, and citizens who work together to reward public goods and build a sustainable future for Ethereum."
"41", "What is the main goal of the Optimism Collective?", "The main goal of the Optimism Collective is to demonstrate that public goods can be profitable by aligning incentives properly and supporting projects that benefit the common good."
"41", "How does the Optimism Collective plan to fund public goods?", "The Optimism Collective plans to fund public goods through a model called retroactive public goods funding, which rewards projects and communities after their usefulness has been demonstrated."
"42", "Who was eligible for Optimism's Airdrop #1?", "The Optimism Foundationâ€™s Airdrop #1 was designed to reward early adopters and active users of projects in the Optimism ecosystem. In total, 248,699 addresses were eligible to claim OP tokens. The eligibility criteria included early adopters and active users of OP Mainnet, DAO voters, multisig signers, Gitcoin donors on L1, and users priced out of Ethereum."
"42", "When was the snapshot for Airdrop #1 taken?", "The snapshot of addresses eligible for Airdrop #1 was taken on March 25, 2022, at 0:00 UTC."
"42", "What should I do if I missed out on Airdrop #1?", "If you missed out on Airdrop #1, don't worry! This is just the first airdrop, and 14% of the total initial token supply is reserved for future airdrops. The best way to earn OP tokens in the future is to get involved in the Optimism Collective by building on Optimism, participating in the community, or exploring projects on OP Mainnet."
"43", "How many OP tokens were distributed in Optimism's Airdrop #2?", "Optimism's Airdrop #2 distributed 11,742,277.10 OP tokens to 307,965 unique addresses."
"43", "Do I need to claim my tokens for Airdrop #2?", "No, Airdrop #2 tokens are distributed directly to eligible wallets. There is no need to claim tokens by interacting with any website."
"43", "What are the criteria for receiving rewards in Airdrop #2?", "The criteria for receiving rewards in Airdrop #2 include governance delegation rewards based on the amount of OP delegated and the length of time it was delegated, partial gas rebates for active Optimism users who have spent over a certain amount on gas fees, and multiplier bonuses determined by additional attributes related to governance and usage."
"44", "How many unique addresses received tokens in Airdrop 3?", "Airdrop 3 allocated 19,411,313 OP to 31,870 unique addresses."
"44", "Do I need to claim my tokens for Airdrop 3?", "No, Airdrop 3 is disbursed directly to eligible wallets. There is no need to claim tokens by interacting with any website. If an address is eligible, it will have tokens sent directly to it on or shortly after September 15, 2023."
"44", "What are the eligibility criteria for receiving tokens in Airdrop 3?", "To be eligible for Airdrop 3, users must have delegated tokens between January 20, 2023, and July 20, 2023. Addresses with fewer than 18,000 'OP Delegated x Days' (or 9,000 if delegated to a voting delegate) were not eligible. Additionally, addresses who were delegated for less than 7 days or known delegation program wallets were not eligible. A bonus is given to addresses that delegated to a delegate who voted in Optimism Governance."
"45", "Who is eligible for Airdrop #4 from Optimism?", "Creators with addresses that deployed NFT contracts on Ethereum L1, Base, OP Mainnet, and Zora before January 10, 2024, are eligible for Airdrop #4."
"45", "How can I claim my Airdrop #4 rewards?", "You can claim your Airdrop #4 rewards by visiting [https://app.optimism.io/airdrops](https://app.optimism.io/airdrops)."
"45", "What are the bonus attributes for Airdrop #4 and how do they affect the rewards?", "There are five bonus attributes that can increase your rewards: Early creator, Rising creator, Active onchain, Popular creator, and We <3 the Art. Depending on the number of attributes you qualify for, you can receive a multiplier bonus ranging from 1.05x to 1.50x on your rewards."
"46", "How does Optimism plan to reward users and contributors?", "Optimism rewards users and contributors through a series of airdrops and funding programs. For example, they have allocated 19% of their OP tokens for user airdrops to reward positive behaviors and contributions. Additionally, they have an Ecosystem Fund and Retroactive Public Goods Funding to support projects and public goods that benefit the community."
"46", "What is the purpose of the Ecosystem Fund in Optimism?", "The Ecosystem Fund, which is allocated 25% of the OP tokens, is designed to stimulate development within the Optimism ecosystem. It provides funding to communities and companies that drive the expansion of the ecosystem. The fund is divided into categories like the Governance Fund, Partner Fund, and Seed Fund, each aimed at supporting different aspects of ecosystem growth."
"46", "What are Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) rounds?", "Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) rounds are quarterly events where Optimism rewards public goods based on their impact on the ecosystem. This funding is sourced from the initial OP token supply and network revenues. The goal is to ensure that impactful projects are adequately and reliably rewarded."
"47", "How does the Citizens' House contribute to the governance of the Optimism Collective?", "The Citizens' House is responsible for voting on the allocation of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding). In its initial stage, it focuses solely on this task, but in future stages, its role will expand to include governing the allocation of surplus protocol revenue, collaborating on criteria for participation, and enforcing the Collectiveâ€™s Codes of Conduct."
"47", "What is Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) and how does it work?", "Retro Funding is based on the idea that itâ€™s easier to agree on what was useful in the past than what might be useful in the future. Members of the Citizensâ€™ House allocate surplus protocol revenue or portions of the Retro Funding token allocation to projects that have provided a positive impact to the Optimism Collective. This creates incentives for people to build public goods that benefit the community, driving application usage and generating more demand for blockspace."
"47", "How is the scope and voting process for Retro Funding determined?", "During the initial stages, the Optimism Foundation determines the scope and amount of each funding round and administers the voting process. Over time, the Citizensâ€™ House will take on more responsibility for these decisions, with checks and balances from the Token House. The process involves regular rounds of funding, each different from the last, to refine tools and processes based on community participation and experimentation."
"48", "How does the Citizens' House in Optimism differ from the Token House?", "The Citizens' House relies on identity-based governance, where citizens represent individual human stakeholders like builders, users, and community members aligned with the project's values. This is different from the Token House, which uses token-voting governance."
"48", "What is the purpose of the AttestationStation in Optimism's governance?", "The AttestationStation is a neutral, permissionless attestation contract used by Optimism Governance to determine the set of Citizens. It allows the governance system to use any reputation data written to it to decide on Citizenship in future iterations of the Citizens' House."
"48", "How is Citizenship in the Citizens' House expected to evolve over time?", "Initially, participants receive temporary badges to vote in Retro Funding rounds. Over time, the criteria for Citizenship will evolve, and the Token House and Citizens' House will collaborate on setting ongoing criteria. This means holding a voting badge now does not guarantee future voting rights, as membership will eventually be determined by governance and may change."
"49", "How can I find out who my current delegate is and see their voting record?", "You can identify your current delegate and view their voting record by visiting this [link](https://help.optimism.io/hc/en-us/articles/6389519530779-How-do-I-see-how-my-delegate-voted-)."

"50", "How can I participate in Token House governance without a significant time commitment?", "You can delegate your OP tokens to community members who have volunteered to play an active role in Token House governance. This allows you to participate without needing to commit a lot of time."
"50", "What should I be familiar with before deciding to become a delegate?", "Before deciding to become a delegate, you should be familiar with the Working Constitution, the Operating Manual, and the Code of Conduct."
"50", "What is the first step to becoming a delegate?", "The first step to becoming a delegate is to read the delegate responsibilities on the forum and make sure you understand them."
"51", "How does the Optimism Collective generate value for its ecosystem?", "The Optimism Collective generates value by funding public goods, which creates a thriving ecosystem. Value accrues to tokenholders through the productive re-deployment of sequencer revenue, to contributors and builders through retroactive public goods funding, and to users and community members through ongoing airdrops of OP and project incentives."
"51", "What is Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) and how does it work?", "Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) is a mechanism where sequencer revenue is distributed back to the ecosystem to reward individuals, teams, projects, or communities that have provided subjective value over a specified time period. The Citizensâ€™ House votes quarterly on these distributions, which compensates contributors for their positive impact and allows them to raise capital based on the early potential of their projects."
"51", "How does funding public goods drive demand for blockspace in the Optimism ecosystem?", "Funding public goods drives growth and network revenues from the ground up by making the ecosystem easier to build on, learn about, and connect to. This, in turn, drives application usage and generates more demand for blockspace, creating a positive feedback loop that benefits the entire ecosystem."
"52", "How can I participate in general governance discussions for Optimism?", "You can join the conversation in the #gov-general channel on Optimism's Discord. This channel is dedicated to general governance discussions."
"52", "What should I do if I am a Top 100 delegate in Optimism?", "If you are a Top 100 delegate, you should join the #delegate-discussion channel on Discord to discuss proposals and the governance process with other larger delegates. You can also approve non-grant proposals by posting a specific phrase in a forum comment on Discourse, and vote on these proposals via the Optimism Governance Portal."
"52", "When do the community calls for Optimism governance take place?", "The community calls occur every other Tuesday at 1pm ET. You can check the governance calendar to see which Tuesdays the calls are scheduled for and how to join them."
"53", "How can I get funding for a project I want to build on Optimism?", "You can apply for a Collective Grant or Retro Funding. Collective Grants are for projects to be completed in the future and are distributed upon completion of specified milestones. Retro Funding rewards projects that have already been completed based on their impact."
"53", "What are the different types of grants available through Optimism?", "There are two main types of grants: Collective Grants and Retro Funding. Collective Grants are for future projects and are distributed upon completion of milestones. Retro Funding rewards projects that have already been completed based on their impact."
"53", "How do I apply for a Mission Grant on Optimism?", "To apply for a Mission Grant, find an open Mission Request on the list provided on their GitHub, submit your application via the application link or as a comment on the GitHub Issue, and your application will be evaluated by the Grants Council or the Optimism Foundation."
"54", "How much of the total initial token supply is allocated to the Governance Fund?", "5.4% of the total initial token supply, which amounts to 231,928,234 OP, is allocated to the Governance Fund."
"54", "What is the main goal of the Governance Fund?", "The main goal of the Governance Fund is to empower the OP community to proactively incentivize future growth of projects and communities within the Optimism ecosystem."
"54", "Can projects that have already received a grant apply for more funding?", "Yes, projects that have had a proposal approved are still eligible to apply for further proposals. They are encouraged to reference data from the success of their initial distribution to strengthen their case in future proposals."
"55", "Why should I delegate my OP tokens?", "Delegating your OP tokens allows you to participate in the governance of the Optimism Token House without needing to commit a lot of time. You can delegate your voting power to a community member who has volunteered to be an active participant in governance. This way, your interests are represented without you having to vote on every issue yourself."
"55", "How can I choose a delegate for my OP tokens?", "To choose a delegate, you should first read through the delegate statements of interest on the Optimism voting site. This is an important decision because a good delegate will help maintain a healthy governance system, which benefits all OP holders. Once you have chosen a delegate, you can go to the voting app to delegate your tokens to them. Remember, you will retain full ownership of your tokens even though the delegate will vote on your behalf."
"55", "What should I do if I want to vote myself?", "If you prefer to vote yourself, you need to delegate your tokens to yourself first. You can do this by registering via the Optimism Governance Portal, connecting your wallet, and creating your delegate statement. After that, you can go to the voting app to ensure your tokens are delegated to your own address. Once you are added as a delegate in the next voting cycle, you can start voting directly."
"56", "Is the Law of Chains a legally binding contract?", "No, the Law of Chains is not a legally binding contract. It is a set of guidelines intended to guide Optimism Governance and participants in the Optimism Collective. It does not provide any legally enforceable rights, obligations, or warranties."
"56", "What should I do if I believe Participant Protections have been violated?", "If you believe Participant Protections have been violated, you can appeal to Optimism Governance. However, it's important to note that Optimism Governance is not a legal entity or a singular adjudicative body. It is a collection of independent voters, and its outcomes cannot be guaranteed."
"56", "Does the Law of Chains create any formal relationships among participants?", "No, the Law of Chains does not create any formal relationships such as partnerships, joint ventures, employment, franchises, or agency relationships among participants. Each participant acts independently and bears their own risks and rewards."
"57", "Where can I find videos related to Optimism governance?", "You can find governance videos on the Optimism Governance Documentation page under the 'Governance Videos' section. This includes videos from events like ETHDenver 2023 and presentations on various governance initiatives."
"57", "What is 'The Iterative Nature of Optimism Governance' video about?", "In 'The Iterative Nature of Optimism Governance' video, Justine from the Optimism Foundation talks to delegates involved with Optimism governance about their experiences. The video covers different governance initiatives such as the Grants Council and Protocol Delegate Program, emphasizing the iterative nature of Optimism governance."
"57", "What is 'The Collective DAO Archive' and where can I access it?", "The 'Collective DAO Archive' is a presentation by Justine that shares findings from her research into DAO governance and policy. She organized her research into 10 categories with actionable takeaways and open-sourced her work. You can access the searchable library of DAO policies, programs, and processes through the provided link in the documentation."
"58", "How can I apply for grant funding from the Governance Fund?", "You can apply for grant funding from the Governance Fund by submitting an application to a Mission Request. This application will be evaluated by the Optimism Grants Council or Foundation. More details can be found in the Mission Applicant Guide."
"58", "Do I need to hold a minimum amount of tokens to submit a proposal?", "No, there is no minimum holding requirement for submitting a proposal. However, all non-grant proposals must be approved by four delegates with sufficient voting power to move to a vote."
"58", "What types of proposals can I submit besides grant proposals?", "Besides grant proposals, there are other types of proposals you can submit. The specific types and the process for submitting them are detailed in the Operating Manual."

"64", "What is the main purpose of the Optimism Foundation?", "The main purpose of the Optimism Foundation is to support the establishment of the Optimism Collective, develop the Optimism ecosystem, and advance the technology that powers it. It also provides a formal legal entity to support the Collective and stewards the early evolution of Collective governance."
"64", "How does the Optimism Foundation ensure it remains accountable to the community?", "The Optimism Foundation is legally accountable to its governing documentation, which requires it to observe and implement the outcome of valid governance votes. There are specific governance proposal types to ensure accountability, including treasury appropriations, director removal, and rights protections. These mechanisms allow the community to influence the Foundation's actions and ensure it aligns with the will of the Optimism Collective."
"65", "Where can I find a guide to start deploying a basic contract on OP Mainnet?", "If you're brand new to OP Mainnet, you can start by checking out the guide to deploying a basic contract [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/getting-started). This guide will help you get familiar with the core steps required to deploy a contract to the network."
"65", "Is deploying a contract on OP Mainnet different from deploying on Ethereum?", "No, deploying a contract on OP Mainnet is not different from deploying on Ethereum because OP Mainnet is EVM equivalent. This means it's 100% the same as deploying a contract to Ethereum."
"65", "Where can I get testnet ETH for OP Mainnet?", "You can get testnet ETH for OP Mainnet using the [Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet) or by checking out other network faucet options listed [here](../useful-tools/faucets.md)."
"66", "Why should I consider using the Standard bridge before developing a custom bridge?", "The Standard bridge is designed to satisfy a wide range of requirements for bridging assets between L1 and L2. It locks the ERC20 tokens on L1 and mints an equivalent amount on L2, and vice versa for withdrawals. This implementation is secure and efficient for many use cases, so it's recommended to try it first before opting for a custom solution."
"66", "When would I need to build a custom bridge instead of using the Standard bridge?", "You might need to build a custom bridge if the Standard bridge does not meet your specific requirements. For example, if you need custom logic for managing token supply, if you are bridging non-ERC20 tokens like NFTs, or if you are pooling deposits for cheaper transfers to L2. Custom bridges allow for more flexibility in these scenarios."
"66", "What are the requirements for adding a custom bridge for ERC20 tokens to the Superchain token list?", "To add a custom bridge for ERC20 tokens to the Superchain token list, your bridge contracts must implement the `IL1ERC20Bridge` interface in the L1 bridge contract and the `IL2ERC20Bridge` interface in the L2 bridge contract. This ensures compatibility with the OP Mainnet Bridge UI for token deposits and withdrawals. Additionally, you need to make a pull request against the Superchain token list repository and deploy to OP Goerli for review before going to production."
"67", "How do I connect to the OP Mainnet?", "You connect to OP Mainnet the same way you do to Ethereum, by connecting to a JSON RPC endpoint. You can choose between public endpoints, which are rate limited, and private endpoints from infrastructure providers."
"67", "Are the token addresses on OP Mainnet the same as on Ethereum?", "No, the ERC-20 contract address for a token on OP Mainnet may be different from the address for the same token on Ethereum. You can find the list of tokens and their addresses on the Optimism website."
"67", "How do transaction fees work on OP Mainnet?", "Most of the cost of an OP Mainnet transaction is not the gas consumed by the transaction itself but the cost of writing the transaction in Ethereum. This cost is deducted automatically from the user's balance on OP Mainnet."
"68", "Can I create NFTs on the OP Mainnet without knowing how to code?", "Yes, you can create NFTs on the OP Mainnet without knowing how to code using tools like NiftyKit, nft-inator, Zero Code NFT, and Unlock. These platforms offer no-code deployment options."
"68", "What are some popular marketplaces where I can buy or sell NFTs on the OP Mainnet?", "Some popular marketplaces for buying or selling NFTs on the OP Mainnet include Quix, OpenSea, Tofu, OptiMarket, and Circular Art."
"68", "Are there any tools available to use NFTs as collateral on the OP Mainnet?", "Yes, you can use NFTs as collateral on the OP Mainnet through a platform called Backed."
"69", "How can I get test tokens on the OP Goerli network?", "You can obtain test tokens, including ETH, ERC-20, and NFT tokens, from faucets. You can find more information on how to access these faucets [here](../useful-tools/faucets.md)."
"69", "Where can I find the addresses for ERC-20 testing tokens on OP Goerli?", "The addresses for ERC-20 testing tokens on OP Goerli are as follows:

"69", "How can I get NFT tokens for testing on OP Goerli?", "You can get NFT tokens for testing on OP Goerli by calling the `faucet` function on the ERC-721 token contract at address [`0x38abA480f2bA7A17bC01EE5E1AD64fCedd93EfE7`](https://goerli-explorer.optimism.io/address/0x38abA480f2bA7A17bC01EE5E1AD64fCedd93EfE7)."
"70", "How can I connect my wallet to OP Mainnet?", "You can connect your wallet to OP Mainnet using the Ethereum JSON-RPC API with a few minor differences. You can use rate-limited public endpoints, private endpoints from infrastructure providers, or run your own node. For production applications, it's recommended to use private node providers or run your own node due to throughput limits."
"70", "What are the different states a transaction can be in on OP Mainnet?", "A transaction on OP Mainnet can be in one of two states: 'Sequencer Confirmed' (accepted by the sequencer on OP Mainnet) and 'Confirmed Onchain' (written to Ethereum). Wallets should consider transactions final after they are 'Sequencer Confirmed', which happens as soon as the transaction receipt shows at least one confirmation."
"70", "How are transaction fees calculated on OP Mainnet?", "Transaction fees on OP Mainnet include both an L1 data fee and an L2 execution fee. The L2 execution fee is composed of a fixed base fee and a user-selected priority fee. The base fee can vary significantly within a short period, so it's recommended to specify a higher base fee to ensure acceptance. The priority fee is the amount the user actually pays and should be kept as low as possible."
"71", "Why is decentralized identity important?", "Decentralized identity is important because it allows individuals to customize their identity according to their preferences, move it seamlessly across services, and regain control of their personal information from centralized platforms. It also enables users to prove specific attributes about themselves in a trustworthy and verifiable way without compromising their privacy or security."
"71", "What role does decentralized identity play in the Optimism Collective?", "In the Optimism Collective, decentralized identity is central to the mission of building a better economic engine that fuels positive-sum games. It supports the two-house governance system composed of token holders and community members who participate in a one-person-one-vote system based on reputation and community contributions. This helps create a more democratic and inclusive governance structure."
"71", "How does the AttestationStation contribute to decentralized identity?", "The AttestationStation serves as a key component in achieving the vision of decentralized identity. It functions as a multiplayer database, and its underlying network of attestations lays the foundation for constructing decentralized identity systems that can effectively scale and adapt to the evolving needs of users and developers. This helps establish a more diverse and trustworthy network of identities."
"72", "Can you give me an example of an application that uses the AttestationStation on Optimism?", "One example is EAS Scan, which is a no-code interface that lets you build schemas, query, and submit attestations."
"72", "What is the purpose of the Citizen Attestations application?", "Citizen Attestations is an attestation explorer for Optimism that focuses on attestations relevant for the OP Citizens eligibility process."
"72", "What can I do with the Attest Fest application?", "With Attest Fest, you can create multiple EAS attestations using the power of CSV and Safe multisig wallets."
"73", "Can I still use AttestationStation v0 for my project?", "AttestationStation v0 is deprecated and not actively supported. It is recommended to use AttestationStation v1 instead."
"73", "What information do I need to search for an attestation?", "To search for an attestation, you need to know the creator, the address it is about, and the key. For more detailed searches, such as 'all attestations about address X' or 'all attestations created by address Y for key Z', you need to search offchain using various APIs."
"73", "Where can I find the AttestationStation v0 contract?", "The legacy AttestationStation v0 contract is located in the Optimism monorepo and is deployed at address 0xEE36eaaD94d1Cc1d0eccaDb55C38bFfB6Be06C77 on both Optimism Mainnet and Optimism Goerli."
"74", "How can I read and write attestations on the Optimism network?", "You can read and write attestations on the Optimism network using the EAS scan user interface for OP Mainnet or OP Goerli, the JavaScript SDK, or directly onchain if you need to attest from a smart contract."
"74", "Where can I find the Attestation Contract address for OP Mainnet?", "The Attestation Contract address for OP Mainnet is [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000021](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000021)."
"74", "Is there a way to index attestations on the Optimism network?", "Yes, you can index attestations on the Optimism network using the GraphQL endpoints for OP Mainnet and OP Goerli, the Ponder graph, or the open-source indexer available on GitHub."
"75", "How does the AttestationStation contribute to decentralized identity?", "The AttestationStation is a smart contract that uses the Ethereum Attestation Service standard to create, verify, and revoke attestations both on and off the blockchain. It acts as a multiplayer database that streamlines the attestation process and enables a robust web of trust on any OP Chain in the Superchain."
"75", "What are the privacy considerations when using attestations?", "When using attestations, it's important to obtain explicit consent from users for any personal information collected. Sensitive data should not be stored on-chain; instead, you can use the hash of the sensitive data for future verification. Even when storing sensitive data off-chain, it should be securely stored using encryption, proper authentication, and authorization."
"75", "Are attestations a replacement for verifiable credentials or proof of personhood?", "No, attestations are not replacements for verifiable credentials or proof of personhood. They are complementary. Developers can use attestations to create decentralized identifiers, credentials, and claims. Attestations and the associated web of trust work alongside proof of personhood solutions to provide more information about a person's reputation, which is crucial for governance and other use-cases."
"76", "What's an attestation in the context of decentralized identity?", "An attestation is a statement or evidence of information made by anyone about anything. In decentralized identity, it can be used to verify a person's identity or personal information."
"76", "What is the role of the AttestationStation?", "The AttestationStation is a decentralized, permissionless database for creating, verifying, and revoking on/off-chain attestations on the Superchain. It uses the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) standard."
"76", "What does Sybil-resistance mean?", "Sybil resistance is a defense mechanism that prevents someone from creating multiple fake identities in a decentralized identity system."
"77", "Why is decentralized identity important?", "Decentralized identity is important because it allows individuals to customize their identity according to their preferences, move it seamlessly across services, and regain control of their personal information from centralized platforms. It also enables users to prove specific attributes about themselves in a trustworthy and verifiable way without compromising their privacy or security."
"77", "What role does decentralized identity play in the Optimism Collective?", "In the Optimism Collective, decentralized identity is central to the mission of building a better economic engine that fuels positive-sum games. It supports the two-house governance system composed of token holders and community members who participate in a one-person-one-vote system based on reputation and community contributions. This helps create a more democratic and inclusive governance structure."
"77", "How does the AttestationStation contribute to decentralized identity?", "The AttestationStation serves as a key component in achieving the vision of decentralized identity. It functions as a multiplayer database, and its underlying network of attestations lays the foundation for constructing decentralized identity systems that can effectively scale and adapt to the evolving needs of users and developers. This helps create more secure, transparent, and democratic systems."
"78", "Can anyone create an Optimist Profile?", "Yes, anyone can create an Optimist Profile and use it in onchain identity use cases."
"78", "What is the purpose of the Optimist Profile?", "The Optimist Profile allows contributors to share their contributions and impact on the Optimism Collective. It also helps create a web of trust through peer-to-peer attestations about contributions."
"78", "What kind of data is used to build an Optimist Profile?", "The Optimist Profile is built using a variety of onchain reputation data on the OP Mainnet, including self-attestations and peer-to-peer attestations about contributions."
"79", "What's the purpose of schemas in Optimism Governance?", "Schemas define the structure and type of data that can be included in an attestation on the OP Mainnet. They ensure that the data is organized and validated correctly."
"79", "Can you give an example of a schema used in Optimism Governance?", "One example is the 'Season 4 Co-grant participant schema UID,' which has the unique identifier `0x401a80196f3805c57b00482ae2b575a9f270562b6b6de7711af9837f08fa0faf`. It's important to verify the attester address for this schema, which should be either `0x3C7820f2874b665AC7471f84f5cbd6E12871F4cC` or `0x2a0eB7cAE52B68e94FF6ab0bFcf0dF8EeEB624be`."
"79", "What is the Ethereum Attestation Service used for in Optimism?", "The Ethereum Attestation Service is used to build schemas that define the structure and type of data for attestations on the OP Mainnet. These schemas help ensure that the data is properly organized and validated."
"80", "Why is simplicity important in the design of Optimism?", "Simplicity is important in the design of Optimism because it reduces engineering overhead, minimizes the potential for bugs, and makes the codebase more accessible to external contributors and auditors. This leads to a more secure and maintainable system."
"80", "How does pragmatism influence the development of Optimism?", "Pragmatism influences the development of Optimism by prioritizing user and developer needs over theoretical perfection. The design process is driven by real-world constraints and feedback from users, leading to practical and iterative improvements."
"80", "What is the long-term vision for sustainability in Optimism?", "The long-term vision for sustainability in Optimism involves ensuring that the platform remains operational and competitive over time. This is achieved by maintaining a simple codebase that encourages community contributions and avoids shortcuts to scalability, thereby supporting a sustainable ecosystem."
"81", "How does Optimism ensure the security of its blockchain?", "Optimism uses a mechanism called Optimistic Rollup, which relies on the security of a parent blockchain, specifically Ethereum. This means that Optimism leverages Ethereum's consensus mechanism (like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake) to ensure its own security."
"81", "What is the role of the sequencer in Optimism?", "The sequencer in Optimism is responsible for managing block production. It provides transaction confirmations and state updates, constructs and executes L2 blocks, and submits user transactions to L1. Currently, the Optimism Foundation runs the only block producer on OP Mainnet."
"81", "How can users transfer assets between Ethereum and OP Mainnet?", "Users can transfer assets between Ethereum and OP Mainnet using the Standard bridge. For deposits (from Ethereum to OP Mainnet), transactions become part of the canonical blockchain in the first L2 block of the corresponding epoch. For withdrawals (from OP Mainnet to Ethereum), the process involves initializing the withdrawal with an L2 transaction, submitting a withdrawal proof, and finalizing the withdrawal after a challenge period."
"82", "How does Optimism plan to improve its fault proof mechanism?", "Optimism is working on upgrading its fault proof mechanism as part of the OVM 2.0 upgrade. Currently, the fault proof mechanism is temporarily disabled, requiring users to trust the Sequencer node run by the Optimism Foundation. The team expects to have the upgraded fault proof mechanism in production by 2023, and you can follow the progress in the Cannon repository."
"82", "What steps is Optimism taking to decentralize the sequencer?", "Optimism plans to decentralize the sequencer by first implementing a system where the sequencer role rotates among different participants. This will involve an economic mechanism to create a competitive market for sequencing and a governance mechanism to ensure sequencers prioritize the long-term health of the network. Eventually, Optimism aims to support multiple concurrent sequencers using a standard BFT consensus protocol."
"82", "Can Optimism currently censor user transactions?", "No, even though the Optimism Foundation currently runs the sole sequencer on OP Mainnet, it does not have the ability to censor user transactions. However, decentralizing the sequencer is still a goal to further enhance the network's robustness and inclusivity."
"83", "How does a deposit transaction work in Optimism?", "In Optimism, a deposit transaction is an L2 transaction triggered by an event or transaction on L1. It involves sending a transaction from L1 to the L1CrossDomainMessenger, which then processes and relays it to L2. The transaction may include assets like ETH or tokens and is encapsulated in a way similar to networking stacks."
"83", "What happens if a deposit transaction fails on L2?", "If a deposit transaction fails on L2, it can be replayed with potentially more gas. This is done by finding the failed transaction's hash and resending it with the appropriate gas limit to ensure it succeeds."
"83", "How does Optimism prevent denial of service (DoS) attacks with deposit transactions?", "Optimism prevents DoS attacks by requiring a gas limit parameter for deposit transactions. This gas limit is encoded into the TransactionDeposited event and used for the L2 transaction, ensuring that the L2 processing cost is covered and preventing attackers from submitting high-cost transactions without bearing the cost."
"84", "How does the Optimism blockchain handle communication between Layer 1 and Layer 2?", "The Optimism blockchain uses several contracts to handle communication between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2). The `L1CrossDomainMessenger` and `L2CrossDomainMessenger` contracts are primarily used for sending messages between L1 (like Ethereum) and L2 (like OP Mainnet). These messages can include assets such as ETH and ERC-20 tokens. Additionally, the `OptimismPortal` contract provides a low-level API for communication between layers, but it's recommended to use the CrossDomainMessenger contracts for most purposes."
"84", "What is the purpose of the L2OutputOracle contract in Optimism?", "The `L2OutputOracle` contract contains the state root of the Optimism blockchain and will receive the result of the fault proof process once fault proofs are activated. It replaces the old State Commitment Chain."
"84", "What is the function of the SequencerFeeVault contract?", "The `SequencerFeeVault` contract handles funding the sequencer on L1 using the ETH base fee on L2. The fees are calculated using the EIP 1559 mechanism, similar to Ethereum but with different parameter values."
"85", "Why am I being redirected when I try to access the sequencing documentation on Optimism's website?", "The redirect is in place because search engines still have the old URL for the sequencing documentation. The new URL is /docs/protocol/#decentralizing-the-sequencer."
"85", "What is the new URL for the sequencing documentation on Optimism's website?", "The new URL for the sequencing documentation is /docs/protocol/#decentralizing-the-sequencer."
"86", "How does a rollup transaction get written to Ethereum (L1)?", "A rollup transaction is written to L1 (Ethereum) by compressing transactions into batches using `op-batcher` and then posting those batches to L1. This ensures the availability and integrity of the transactions."
"86", "What happens after a rollup transaction is executed?", "After a rollup transaction is executed, `op-proposer` writes a commitment to the post-transaction state to L1. This commitment can be written after a block of transactions rather than after each individual transaction."
"86", "When is a transaction considered finalized and irrevocable?", "A transaction is considered finalized and irrevocable once it is written to L1 in an L1 block that is old enough to be extremely unlikely to be re-organized. At this point, the transaction itself is fixed and immutable, although the state after the transaction is still subject to fault challenges."
"87", "How does a withdrawal work in Optimism?", "In Optimism, a withdrawal is a transaction sent from Layer 2 (L2) to Layer 1 (L1). It involves three steps: initiating the withdrawal on L2, proving the withdrawal on L1, and finalizing the withdrawal on L1 after a fault challenge period. This process ensures the transaction is legitimate and secure."
"87", "What are the steps involved in initiating a withdrawal on Optimism?", "To initiate a withdrawal on Optimism, a user or contract calls the `sendMessage` function of the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` on L2. This function requires three parameters: the target address on L1, the calldata for the L1 transaction, and the minimum gas limit for the finalizing transaction. The function then calculates a hash of the withdrawal details and marks it as a sent message."
"87", "What happens during the withdrawal proving transaction on Optimism?", "During the withdrawal proving transaction, the user proves that the message hash is present in L2. This is typically done using the SDK, which retrieves the raw withdrawal fields and the proof. The proof is then submitted to the `OptimismPortal` on L1, which verifies the proof and records it. The user must wait for the fault challenge period to pass before finalizing the withdrawal."
"88", "How does Optimism's gas cost estimation differ from Ethereum's?", "On Ethereum (L1), gas cost is proportional to the gas used by the transaction. However, on Optimism, gas costs are primarily determined by the cost of writing the transaction to L1, which depends on the transaction size rather than the amount of processing required."
"88", "What are the ways to access Optimism services?", "There are three ways to access Optimism services: 1) Onchain contract calls, which allow your contracts to get Optimism information or services directly. 2) The JavaScript SDK, for use when writing JavaScript or TypeScript code, either in the client or a Node.js server. 3) Offchain, using RPC, which is more complicated but usable from any development stack (Python, Rust, etc.)."
"88", "How can I report a bug or suggest a feature for the Optimism SDK?", "You can report a bug or suggest a feature by going on Optimism's Discord and asking in the #dev-support channel, or by submitting an issue on their Github repository."
"89", "Is there an SDK available for Optimism through Alchemy?", "Yes, Alchemy provides an SDK for Optimism in addition to the standard Ethereum RPC interface."
"89", "Where can I find a quickstart guide for the Alchemy SDK?", "You can find a quickstart guide for the Alchemy SDK on the Alchemy documentation website."
"89", "Are there any examples available for using the Alchemy SDK with Optimism?", "Yes, there are examples available for using the Alchemy SDK with Optimism on the Alchemy documentation website."
"90", "How can the OP Stack Client SDK help me with gas costs on OP Mainnet?", "The OP Stack Client SDK can help you navigate the differences in gas costs between OP Mainnet and Ethereum. You can find more information on transaction fees in the documentation."
"90", "Can I use the OP Stack Client SDK with multiple OP Chains?", "Yes, the SDK supports multiple OP Chains such as OP and Base. For a full list of supported chains, you can refer to the documentation. If a chain is not officially supported, you can still use it by providing the L1 contract addresses to the SDK."
"90", "Where can I find tutorials for using the OP Stack Client SDK?", "You can find tutorials for various tasks such as viewing transactions between layers, bridging ETH, bridging ERC-20 tokens, and estimating the costs of an OP (L2) transaction on the Optimism GitHub repository."
"91", "Who manages the security of OP Mainnet?", "The security of OP Mainnet is managed by a multisig wallet controlled by several anonymous individuals. This setup is intended to make the multisig more difficult to compromise."
"91", "Are there any risks associated with using OP Mainnet?", "Yes, using OP Mainnet inherently exposes you to the risk of bugs within the Optimism codebase. Although the codebase has been audited repeatedly, audits are not a guarantee that the code is free of bugs. Users should be aware that there is a risk of losing some or all of their assets."
"91", "Does OP Mainnet currently have fault proofs?", "No, OP Mainnet does not currently have fault proofs. The system is fully dependent on the upgrade keys for security, and fault proofs do not meaningfully improve security if the system can be upgraded within the 7-day challenge window."
"92", "How does Optimism handle security and bug reporting?", "Optimism takes security very seriously and has a comprehensive bug bounty program. They have given out one of the largest bounty payouts ever for a critical bug. They have detailed information on their Bug Bounty Page on Immunefi, and they also run specific contests like the Bedrock Audit Contest. If you find a critical or major bug not covered by existing bounties, you can still report it via the Immunefi program."
"92", "Where can I find detailed information about Optimism's bug bounty program?", "You can find detailed information about Optimism's bug bounty program on their Bug Bounty Page on Immunefi. This page includes all the information related to assets in scope, reporting, and the payout process."
"92", "What should I do if I find a bug that is not covered by Optimism's existing bug bounty programs?", "If you find a critical or major bug that is not covered by Optimism's existing bug bounty programs, you should still report it via the Immunefi program. Optimism will seriously consider the impact of any issues and has previously rewarded security researchers for bugs not within the stated scope of the program."
"93", "Why are there still privileged roles in OP Mainnet?", "In the current state of decentralization, some privileged roles are necessary for the system to function properly. These roles include managing transaction batches, submitting state roots, minting new tokens, and controlling system configurations, among others."
"93", "What is the role of the Batcher in OP Mainnet?", "The Batcher is a component that submits new transaction batches. It has specific addresses on both the Mainnet and Goerli testnet. If the Batcher's account is compromised, it could enable denial of service attacks against the rollup."
"93", "What happens if the MintManager Owner account is compromised?", "If the MintManager Owner account is compromised, attackers can mint an endless supply of OP tokens. Conversely, if access to this account is lost, there would be no ability to mint new OP tokens."
"94", "How can I connect to an Optimism node?", "You can connect to an Optimism node by using the list of networks and node providers available in the Optimism Governance Documentation."
"94", "Where can I get ETH for deployment gas fees on OP Mainnet?", "You can get ETH for deployment gas fees by using one of the available faucets or by bridging ETH using the OP Mainnet Gateway."

"95", "How does account abstraction improve user experience in dapps?", "Account abstraction allows users to use smart contracts as their accounts, which can enhance user experience by enabling features like batching transactions together, offering wallets with easy recovery and no seed phrase, sponsoring gas fees for transactions, and allowing users to pay gas in the token(s) of their choice."
"95", "Is it cheaper to deploy a contract wallet on Optimism compared to Ethereum Mainnet?", "Yes, deploying a contract wallet on the OP Stack costs 34 times less than on the Ethereum Mainnet."
"95", "What tools are available on OP Mainnet to support account abstraction?", "Some tools available on OP Mainnet for account abstraction include Station, Alchemy, Biconomy, CyberConnect, Pimlico, and Stackup."
"96", "Can I use standard Ethereum debugging tools with OP Mainnet?", "Yes, since OP Mainnet is EVM Equivalent, most Ethereum debugging tools work out of the box with OP Mainnet."
"96", "What is Tenderly and how can it help me with transactions on OP Mainnet?", "Tenderly is a tool that lets you inspect any transaction execution on OP Mainnet or OP Goerli. It allows you to inspect the state of your verified contract at any step of the transaction's execution and helps you understand the execution flow, reducing development time."
"96", "Where can I see events and revert messages for transactions on OP Mainnet?", "You can use Etherscan to see events and revert messages for transactions that have been mined on OP Mainnet as well as OP Goerli."

"97", "How can I access older transaction history on Optimism?", "You can access older transaction history on Optimism using the Etherscan CSV exporting tool for transactions between 23 June 2021 and the final regenesis on 11 November 2021. For transactions before 23 June 2021, you can follow a process involving cloning go-ethereum, downloading specific datadir folders, and using ERC20 events filters."
"97", "What tools are available for debugging transactions on Optimism?", "For debugging transactions on Optimism, you can use Etherscan, which has various tools to help you debug transactions. Additionally, the Tenderly Dashboard offers extremely detailed execution traces, accurate gas estimates, and RPC customization for in-depth debugging and transaction simulation."
"98", "How can I get testnet ETH to deploy a smart contract on OP Sepolia?", "You can get testnet ETH from a faucet, which is a developer tool that provides free testnet ETH for testing purposes. One option is the Superchain Faucet hosted by OP Labs, which allows you to get testnet ETH for various OP Chains including OP Sepolia."
"98", "Do testnet tokens have any real value?", "No, tokens on testnet networks like OP Sepolia have no real value. They are only used for testing purposes to help developers test and troubleshoot their decentralized applications or protocols before going live on the mainnet."
"98", "What are some additional faucets where I can get testnet ETH for OP Goerli?", "You can use Paradigm's MultiFaucet, Coinbase Faucet, or QuickNode Faucet to get testnet ETH for OP Goerli. These faucets provide an easy way to acquire testnet ETH for testing your applications."
"99", "Can you explain what meta-transactions are?", "Meta-transactions allow users to sign transactions that are then submitted and the gas paid for by someone else. This can be useful for onboarding new users, enhancing privacy, and allowing transaction payments through different means like other tokens or credit cards."
"99", "Why is OP Mainnet a good place for meta-transactions?", "OP Mainnet is a good place for meta-transactions because its low gas costs make it feasible to explore business models that allow for alternative payment methods for transactions."
"99", "What is the Gas Station Network (OpenGSN) and how does it work?", "The Gas Station Network (OpenGSN) is distributed infrastructure for meta-transactions that lets you create your own relay or pay other relays to relay your users' traffic. Relays must post a bond, which they lose if they attempt to censor transactions. This ensures the integrity of the transaction process."
"100", "Where can I check the current status of the OP Mainnet?", "You can check the current status of the OP Mainnet on the [OP Mainnet status page](https://status.optimism.io/). This page includes information about public APIs, the gateway, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction sequencing for both OP Mainnet and OP Goerli."

"101", "Where can I find the list of contract addresses for the OP Sepolia test network?", "The authoritative list of contract addresses for the OP Sepolia test network can be found in the monorepo at this link: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deployments/sepolia."
"102", "How do oracles help blockchain applications access offchain data?", "Oracles provide offchain data onchain, allowing blockchain applications to access a wide variety of information. For example, a stablecoin that accepts ETH as collateral needs to know the ETH/USD exchange rate to determine how many stablecoins to give a user for a given amount of ETH and whether any deposits need to be liquidated because they are under-collateralized."
"102", "What is the difference between push oracles and pull oracles?", "Push oracles are updated continuously and always have up-to-date information available onchain. Pull oracles, on the other hand, are only updated when information is requested by a contract. Pull oracles can be further divided into double-transaction oracles, which require two transactions, and single-transaction oracles, which require only one transaction."
"102", "What is the role of the Gas Price Oracle on OP Mainnet?", "The Gas Price Oracle on OP Mainnet provides information about gas prices and related parameters. It can also calculate the total cost of a transaction before it is sent. This oracle is a push oracle, meaning it is updated continuously whenever gas price parameters change, with the L1 gas price being updated every 5 minutes and changing by up to 20% each time."
